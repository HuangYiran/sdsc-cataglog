name: QSAR-TID-11556
dataset_id: 3060.0
description: QSAR-TID-11556 is a dataset consisting of 561 chemical compounds divided into two classes: active and inactive. The aim is to develop a model that can accurately classify the compounds into their respective classes based on their molecular features. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors such as topological, radial, and electrostatic descriptors. Additionally, it contains information on the compounds' toxicity represented by LD50 values. The dataset provides an opportunity to explore and analyze the relationship between molecular features and compound activity, aiding in the development of predictive models for toxicology research and drug design.
