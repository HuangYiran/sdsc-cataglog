name: AP_Endometrium_Lung
dataset_id: 1154.0
description: The dataset AP_Endometrium_Lung contains gene expression data from endometrium and lung tissues. It consists of gene expression profiles of 22,283 genes from 87 samples, including 41 endometrium and 46 lung samples. The samples were obtained from patients with Endometriosis or Adenomyosis and patients undergoing lung surgery. The dataset provides valuable information for studying gene expression patterns and identifying potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets related to endometrial and lung diseases. The data could be used in various analyses, including differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and network analysis. This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial and lung-related disorders.
