name: QSAR-TID-10782
dataset_id: 3338.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10782 consists of 33,405 chemical compounds, each described by 1,171 features. It was developed for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. The compounds are classified into two classes: active and inactive for a specific target. The target is relevant to different drugs, possibly indicating their potential effects on various diseases. The features represent molecular descriptors that characterize the chemical compounds. The dataset underwent a feature selection procedure to reduce the dimensionality and select the most informative features. It can be utilized for developing machine learning models to predict the activity of chemical compounds and aid in drug discovery and development processes.
