name: AP_Endometrium_Breast
dataset_id: 1123.0
description: The AP_Endometrium_Breast dataset consists of molecular profiles of endometrial and breast cancer samples. It includes gene expression data, copy number variation information, and clinical data for each sample. The dataset provides an opportunity to study the molecular characteristics and genomic alterations in these two types of cancer. It also allows researchers to analyze the relationship between gene expression patterns, copy number variations, and clinical outcomes. This dataset can help in identifying potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets specific to endometrial and breast cancer, contributing to a deeper understanding of their biology and potentially informing personalized treatment strategies.
