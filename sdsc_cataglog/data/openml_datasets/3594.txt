name: Stars-from-Gaia-DR2-and-RAVE-DR5
dataset_id: 43669.0
description: The dataset "Stars-from-Gaia-DR2-and-RAVE-DR5" combines information from two major astronomical surveys, Gaia DR2 and RAVE DR5, and focuses on stars within the Milky Way galaxy. Gaia DR2 provides high-precision astrometric and photometric measurements, while RAVE DR5 offers spectroscopic data. The dataset contains various parameters such as stellar coordinates, magnitudes, colors, parallaxes, radial velocities, effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity. It covers a wide range of spectral types, including main-sequence stars, giants, and white dwarfs. This comprehensive dataset enables researchers to study various aspects of stellar properties, kinematics, and galactic structure.
