name: hepar2_9
dataset_id: 45195.0
description: The dataset hepar2_9 contains information related to the activity of heparin, a type of anticoagulant drug. It includes data on the molecular structure of heparin and its analogs, as well as their corresponding activities in inhibiting blood clot formation. The dataset consists of 9 samples and provides details such as the chemical composition, potency, and biological activity of each sample. The dataset aims to aid in the analysis and understanding of the structure-activity relationship of heparins. It can be used by researchers to study and develop new anticoagulant drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects.
