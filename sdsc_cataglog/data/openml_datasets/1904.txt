name: QSAR-TID-12659
dataset_id: 3889.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12659 consists of 15 molecular descriptors and 1403 samples. It focuses on classifying a compound's mutagenic activity, which is the ability to cause genetic mutations. The molecular descriptors provide information about the compound's chemical properties, such as its size, shape, and polarity. The dataset also includes the experimental class values, indicating whether a compound is mutagenic or non-mutagenic. It is intended for use in developing machine learning models to predict a compound's mutagenic activity based on its molecular descriptors.
