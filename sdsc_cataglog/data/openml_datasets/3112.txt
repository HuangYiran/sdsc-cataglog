description: The digital-colposcopy-hinselmann dataset is a collection of images obtained from digital colposcopy, a technique used to examine cervical tissue for early signs of cervical cancer. It consists of 287 images, where each image is taken under different lighting conditions and magnifications, with the presence or absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of varying severity. The dataset includes information about the patients' age, histology findings, and cervical transformation zone (TZ) type. It aims to aid in the development and evaluation of algorithms for automated cervix segmentation and classification, which can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screenings.
