name: QSAR-TID-17086
dataset_id: 4030.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17086 consists of various properties and biological activities of molecules. It was created to study the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), which aims to predict the level of activity or biological effect of a chemical compound based on its structural attributes. This dataset includes information about the molecular structures, molecular descriptors, and measured biological activities of the molecules. The dataset is valuable for developing predictive models and understanding the relationship between the chemical structure and biological activity. It can be used to aid in drug discovery and design processes. Overall, QSAR-TID-17086 is a comprehensive dataset that facilitates research in the field of chemical and bioactivity prediction.
