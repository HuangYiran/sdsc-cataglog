name: QSAR-TID-103111
dataset_id: 3160.0
description: The QSAR-TID-103111 dataset is a compilation of chemical compounds with corresponding biological activities. It contains a total of 1427 compounds and 2 descriptors that represent the physicochemical properties of each compound. The biological activities of these compounds are measured using EC50 values, which indicate the concentration required to achieve 50% of the desired biological effect. The dataset also includes the SMILES notation, which represents the chemical structure of each compound. QSAR-TID-103111 serves as a valuable resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict biological activities based on the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds.
