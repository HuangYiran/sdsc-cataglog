name: QSAR-TID-10927
dataset_id: 3779.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10927 contains information on 47 chemical compounds and their biological activity against a specific target. The dataset includes 934 molecular descriptors, representing various properties of the compounds. The dataset was curated from different sources and underwent extensive pre-processing to remove duplicates and filter out irrelevant data. The goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset has been made publicly available for research purposes, and it provides a valuable resource for studying the relationship between molecular properties and biological activity.
