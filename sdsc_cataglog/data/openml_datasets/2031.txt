name: QSAR-TID-11110
dataset_id: 4017.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11110 consists of 2227 chemical compounds labeled as either active or inactive based on their effectiveness in inhibiting the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) protein. The compounds were tested using an in vitro assay. Thirty-two molecular descriptors were calculated for each compound using software GRID/CPCA. These descriptors are related to shape, charge, and hydrophobicity of the molecules. The dataset also includes the mentioned target protein (TNF) and its interaction with the compounds. This dataset aims to aid in the development of predictive models for TNF inhibitors and provide insights into the structure-activity relationship of these compounds.
