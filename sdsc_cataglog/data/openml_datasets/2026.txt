description: The QSAR-TID-215 dataset is a collection of 215 compounds, which were tested for their anti-HIV activity. Each compound is represented by a set of molecular descriptors, such as topological, geometric, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical attributes. The activities of the compounds were measured by their ability to inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV. The dataset also provides information about the biological activity class of each compound, such as active, moderately active, or inactive. This dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the anti-HIV activity of new compounds.
