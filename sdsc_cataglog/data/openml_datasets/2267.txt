name: parity5
dataset_id: 40714.0
description: The dataset "parity5" consists of 12,288 binary-encoded examples. Each example is a string of 10 bits, representing a binary number. The task is to predict whether the number has an even or odd number of 1s. The dataset is split into a training set of 10,000 examples and a test set of 2,288 examples. The dataset is generated randomly, with an equal probability of generating binary numbers with even and odd numbers of 1s. The dataset is intended for use in studying the learning of parity functions by machine learning algorithms.
