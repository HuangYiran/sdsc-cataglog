name: QSAR-TID-138
dataset_id: 4122.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-138 is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. It contains 138 compounds with their molecular descriptors and biological activities. The descriptors represent the physicochemical properties of the compounds, such as molecular weight, solubility, and polarity. The biological activities indicate the compounds' potency against a specific target or disease. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models to assess the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity. It can assist in drug discovery and design processes, allowing researchers to identify compounds with potential therapeutic properties based on their structural features.
