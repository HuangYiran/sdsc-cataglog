name: QSAR-TID-12536
dataset_id: 4042.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12536 contains a collection of chemical compound structures and their associated biological activities against a certain target. The compounds are represented by numerical descriptors, which are derived from their molecular structure and physicochemical properties. The dataset includes 1055 compounds and 828 independent variables, describing various features of the compounds. The biological activity is measured using IC50 values, which represent the concentration required to inhibit the target activity by 50%. This dataset is useful for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds against the same target.
