name: QSAR-TID-10274
dataset_id: 4113.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10274 contains information on the quantitive structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of chemical compounds. It consists of 10274 instances with 918 features. Each instance represents a compound, while the features provide details about its structure. The target variable in this dataset is the biological activity of the compounds, which is measured using a logarithm. The dataset includes a wide range of chemical features, such as atom-centered fragments, topological indices, and various descriptors related to the molecular structure. QSAR-TID-10274 is used to explore the relationship between the chemical features and the biological activity of the compounds, aiding in drug discovery and development processes.
