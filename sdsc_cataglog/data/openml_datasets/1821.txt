name: QSAR-TID-11685
dataset_id: 3805.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11685 dataset is a compilation of information about various organic compounds that have undergone toxicity testing. It includes molecular descriptors such as their chemical structures, physicochemical properties, and biological activity. The data is sourced from multiple studies, databases, and predictive models, ensuring a broad range of compounds and properties. The dataset aims to aid in the development of predictive models for assessing the toxicity of organic compounds. This information can be valuable in drug discovery, chemical synthesis, and regulatory decision-making processes. However, due to the complexity and diversity of the data, careful analysis and preprocessing are necessary before using it for predicting toxicity.
