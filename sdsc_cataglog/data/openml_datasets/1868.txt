name: QSAR-TID-10462
dataset_id: 3853.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10462 is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. It consists of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. The dataset includes 1055 instances, where each instance represents a compound and contains 41 attributes. These attributes provide information about the chemical structure and properties of the compounds. The target variable is the biological activity, which is measured using an experimental method known as LD50. The dataset is appropriate for developing QSAR models to predict the toxicity or activity of new chemical compounds based on their structural features.
