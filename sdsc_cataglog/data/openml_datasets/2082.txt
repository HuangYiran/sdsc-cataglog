name: QSAR-TID-100990
dataset_id: 4068.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100990 is created to allow the development and evaluation of models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds. It consists of 201 chemical compounds, each represented by 15 molecular descriptors categorized into four different groups. The molecular descriptors provide information about the chemical properties and structures of the compounds. The toxicity of each compound is represented by the LC50 values, which indicate the concentration at which 50% of test organisms experience lethal effects. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of machine learning models that can predict the toxicity of novel chemical compounds accurately, aiding in the identification of potentially harmful substances.
