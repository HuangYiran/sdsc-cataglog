name: QSAR-TID-142
dataset_id: 3836.0
description: The QSAR-TID-142 dataset is a compilation of 142 compounds with biological activities against the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which causes Chagas disease. The dataset provides information on various physicochemical properties and molecular descriptors of these compounds. It also includes the measured activity values against the parasite. The aim of assembling this dataset was to aid the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the activity of new compounds against the parasite. The dataset is publicly available, allowing researchers to analyze and model the relationship between the chemical structures and activities of these compounds.
