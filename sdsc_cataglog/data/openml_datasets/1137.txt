description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100080 contains information on the biological activity of a set of chemical compounds. It consists of 206 compounds with 8 molecular descriptors that were used to build predictive models. The target variable is the activity as an anti-HIV agent. The dataset includes both active and inactive compounds, with a ratio of approximately 1:4. The compounds were divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) for model evaluation. This dataset can be used for developing machine learning models to predict the biological activity of new chemical compounds as potential anti-HIV agents.
