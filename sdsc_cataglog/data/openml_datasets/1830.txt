name: QSAR-TID-12592
dataset_id: 3814.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12592 is a compilation of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data for a series of chemical compounds. It consists of 2D molecular descriptors and activity values for the compounds, which represent their biological activity. The dataset contains information on 2,000 compounds, with 41 molecular descriptors for each compound. The activity values were measured using an unspecified assay. The dataset is utilized for developing and validating QSAR models to predict the activity of chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. It can be used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of QSAR modeling algorithms and techniques.
