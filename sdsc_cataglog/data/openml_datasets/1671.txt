name: QSAR-TID-100833
dataset_id: 3654.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100833 is a collection of physicochemical properties and biological activities of molecules. It comprises several features related to the compounds' molecular structures, such as molecular weight, protein-ligand interactions, and hydrogen bond descriptors. The dataset also includes information on the compounds' pIC50 values, which represent their inhibitory activity against a target protein. The compounds in this dataset are potential inhibitors for the treatment of a specific disease. QSAR-TID-100833 serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models to identify potential drug candidates and understand the structure-property relationship in drug development.
