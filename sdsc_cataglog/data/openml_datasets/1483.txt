name: QSAR-TID-11018
dataset_id: 3465.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11018 comprises 40,000 compounds with biodegradability values. It contains 14 features, including topological, geometrical, constitutional, and electronic descriptors that characterize the molecular structure of each compound. The compounds were generated using the Biobyte Fragments 1.43 program and validated through a QSAR study. The objective of the dataset is to predict the biodegradability value of these compounds based on their descriptors. This dataset can be useful for researchers working in the field of biodegradation prediction and QSAR modeling, as it provides a large collection of compounds with their corresponding molecular descriptors.
