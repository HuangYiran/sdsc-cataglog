name: QSAR-TID-11407
dataset_id: 3849.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11407 consists of 4,074 chemical compounds and their biological activities. The compounds are represented by different descriptors such as molecular weight and chemical structure. The biological activities of the compounds are measured using the IC50 value, which represents the concentration needed to inhibit biological activity by 50%. The dataset includes compounds with varying IC50 values, indicating different levels of effectiveness in inhibiting the target activity. This dataset is relevant for studying the relationship between chemical descriptors and biological activity and can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models.
