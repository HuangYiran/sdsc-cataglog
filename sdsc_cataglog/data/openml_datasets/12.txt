name: mfeat-fourier
dataset_id: 14.0
description: The dataset "mfeat-fourier" is a collection of hand-drawn images transformed into Fourier coefficients. It consists of a total of 2,000 samples, with each sample having 76 coefficients. These coefficients represent the amplitudes and frequencies of the Fourier series used to approximate the image. The dataset is divided into two separate sets, a training set and a test set, with 2/3 of the samples belonging to the training set. The images in the dataset belong to various categories, including letters, numbers, and geometric shapes. The mfeat-fourier dataset can be used for various tasks, such as pattern recognition and image classification.
