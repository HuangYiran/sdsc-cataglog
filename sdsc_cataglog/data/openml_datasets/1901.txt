name: QSAR-TID-95
dataset_id: 3886.0
description: The QSAR-TID-95 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It was developed for predicting toxicity in drugs and other compounds. The dataset consists of 1055 compounds and 171 attributes, including molecular descriptors, functional groups, and physicochemical properties. The biological activities in the dataset are measured in terms of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), representing the concentration at which a compound inhibits a biological target by 50%. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scientists in the field of drug discovery and toxicity prediction.
