name: QSAR-TID-12947
dataset_id: 3699.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12947 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds with associated biological activities. It consists of 558 compounds, each described by 1333 molecular descriptors. The dataset aims to provide insights into developing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds. The biological activities are measured using an in vitro assay, reporting the logarithm of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (pIC50). QSAR-TID-12947 dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in drug discovery, chemoinformatics, and computational chemistry fields to explore and develop predictive models for biological activities based on structural features of compounds.
