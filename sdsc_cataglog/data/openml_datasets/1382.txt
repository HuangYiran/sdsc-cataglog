name: QSAR-TID-10982
dataset_id: 3359.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10982 dataset contains information about 1211 chemical compounds and their biological activity against the target protein. The dataset includes 1024 molecular descriptors that characterize the structural properties of the compounds, such as atom types, connectivity indices, and topological indices. The biological activity of the compounds is quantified as the pIC50 value, which represents the negative logarithm of the inhibitory concentration against the target protein. The dataset also provides additional information, including the source of the compounds, such as natural products, chemicals, or drugs. Overall, QSAR-TID-10982 dataset offers comprehensive data to explore the relationship between the chemical structure and biological activity of compounds.
