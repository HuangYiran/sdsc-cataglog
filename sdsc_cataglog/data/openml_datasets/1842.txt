name: QSAR-TID-101191
dataset_id: 3827.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101191 dataset consists of 1527 compounds with 41 molecular descriptors. The compounds are labeled as active or inactive based on their biological activities. The dataset aims to establish a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict the biological activity of new compounds. The molecular descriptors represent various chemical properties of the compounds, such as molecular weight, solubility, and electronegativity. The dataset also includes a unique TID identifier for each compound. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery to develop predictive models for identifying active compounds in drug development.
