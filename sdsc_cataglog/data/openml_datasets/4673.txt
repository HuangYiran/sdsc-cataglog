name: cpu_act
dataset_id: 45029.0
description: The dataset "cpu_act" contains information about CPU performance. It includes five attributes: MYCT (minimum memory in kilobytes), MMIN (maximum memory in kilobytes), MMAX (cache memory in kilobytes), CACH (chache memory in kilobytes), and PRP (published relative performance). The dataset contains 209 samples of CPUs from different vendors. The primary goal is to predict the relative CPU performance based on the other attributes. The dataset may be used to analyze the relationship between CPU specifications and performance. The data was collected in the 1980s and can be accessed through various machine learning repositories.
