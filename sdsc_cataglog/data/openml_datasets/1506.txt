name: QSAR-TID-12735
dataset_id: 3489.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12735 contains information about the biological activity of various chemical compounds. It includes 278 molecular descriptors representing the physicochemical properties of the compounds, such as molecular weight and solubility. The dataset also provides the experimental values for the biological activity of the compounds, represented by IC50 values. The dataset aims to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the biological activity of similar chemical compounds. This dataset can be used for machine learning and statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships between the molecular descriptors and the biological activity of the compounds.
