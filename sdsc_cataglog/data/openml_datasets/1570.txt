dataset_id: 3554.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101273 contains information about the biological activity of molecules. It includes 1,273 records with 410 features, which are used to predict the inhibitory concentration required to achieve a certain level of response. The dataset was created by the team of the Laboratory of Chemoinformatics and Molecular Modeling at the University of Tartu. The data was obtained by measuring the biological activities of molecules and synthesizing their chemical features. This dataset is valuable for developing models and methods to predict the activity of molecules, aiding in drug discovery and development processes.
