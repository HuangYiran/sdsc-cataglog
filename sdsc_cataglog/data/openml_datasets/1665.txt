name: QSAR-TID-102580
dataset_id: 3648.0
description: QSAR-TID-102580 is a dataset consisting of 1,192 compounds with different chemical structures and biological activities. The compounds were tested against a specific target receptor protein, and their inhibitory abilities were measured and quantified. This dataset also includes 919 molecular descriptors that provide information on the physical and chemical properties of each compound. The goal of this dataset is to develop QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models that can predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds against the target receptor. The dataset is openly available and can be used by researchers and machine learning experts to develop and validate QSAR models.
