name: QSAR-TID-12345
dataset_id: 3357.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12345 is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. It consists of 8,000 compounds and 5,000 activity labels, signifying active or inactive biological behavior. The dataset's purpose is to construct an effective model that can predict the activity of new compounds accurately. Each compound is represented by 300 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values that characterize the physical and chemical properties of the compounds. The dataset provides a valuable resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models in drug discovery and design.
