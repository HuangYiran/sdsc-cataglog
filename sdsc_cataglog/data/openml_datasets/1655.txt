name: QSAR-TID-12037
dataset_id: 3638.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12037 contains information on the biological activity of various molecules against specific targets. It comprises of 1,203 molecules, each characterized by 4,248 molecular descriptors. These descriptors include topological, electronic, and geometrical properties of the molecules. The dataset aims to train and test the predictive models for the biological activity of the molecules. The biological activity is measured through the ID50 parameter, which represents the concentration required for 50% inhibition. QSAR-TID-12037 is publicly available and can be utilized to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms for predicting the biological activity of molecules.
