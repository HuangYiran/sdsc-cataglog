description: QSAR-TID-11156 is a dataset that contains 6641 instances and 203 features. It pertains to the prediction of skin sensitization, a crucial toxicological endpoint. The dataset includes a binary target variable representing the skin sensitization potential, with 1 indicating sensitization and 0 indicating non-sensitization. The features encompass various molecular descriptors like topological, constitutional, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical descriptors. These descriptors provide information about the chemical properties and structure of the molecules. The dataset aims to assist in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the skin sensitization potential of chemical compounds using machine learning algorithms.
