name: QSAR-TID-12913
dataset_id: 3551.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12913 comprises 1628 unique compounds, along with their molecular features and biological activities. The dataset encompasses a wide range of chemical compounds, including both organic and inorganic substances. The molecular features include multiple descriptors like constitutional, topological, and geometrical attributes, as well as electronic, thermodynamical, and physicochemical properties. The biological activities are represented as the logarithm of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (pIC50) values, which indicate the compound's potency in inhibiting a specific target. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and exploring the relationship between molecular features and biological activity.
