name: QSAR-TID-12956
dataset_id: 3706.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12956 is a collection of physicochemical and pharmacological properties for 5,056 different compounds. These properties were measured to study the potential toxicity and mutagenicity of these compounds. The dataset contains 169 different variables, including attributes like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and various biological descriptors. The target variable in this dataset is the logarithm of the toxic concentration needed for a compound to inhibit 50% of the bacterial growth (log IC50). This dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of new compounds and aid in drug discovery and safety assessment.
