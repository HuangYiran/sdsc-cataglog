name: QSAR-TID-174
dataset_id: 3531.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-174 contains molecular descriptors and activity values for a set of chemical compounds. It was created to develop predictive models for drug-likeness using the Texas Instruments dataset. The dataset consists of 174 compounds with 17 molecular descriptors, including factors related to hydrophobicity, polarity, and electronic effects. The activity values represent the activity of the compounds against the target protein. QSAR-TID-174 has been used in various studies to assess the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting drug-likeness and to evaluate their applicability for virtual screening and drug discovery purposes.
