name: QSAR-TID-101460
dataset_id: 3464.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101460 contains information about 1,460 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activity (target interaction) values. Each compound is represented by 1024 molecular descriptors or features, which were calculated using open source software. These molecular descriptors encompass various chemical properties like electrotopological state, constitutional, and topological information. The biological activity values represent the potency of each compound in inhibiting a specific target in the human body. The dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can help predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular features.
