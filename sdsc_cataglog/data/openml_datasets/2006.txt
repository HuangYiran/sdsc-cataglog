name: QSAR-TID-12104
dataset_id: 3992.0
description: QSAR-TID-12104 is a dataset consisting of 989 unique chemical compounds, aimed at predicting the toxicological activity of chemicals. It contains various physicochemical descriptors and certain molecular fingerprints as features, derived from the three-dimensional structures of the compounds. Each compound is represented by a binary classification label indicating its activity, either active or inactive, against a specific biological target. The dataset's primary purpose is to train machine learning models for binary classification tasks in the field of chemoinformatics and drug discovery. Due to its diverse and curated nature, QSAR-TID-12104 is a valuable resource for developing predictive models in toxicology research.
