name: hill-valley
dataset_id: 1566.0
description: The dataset "hill-valley" consists of 1212 instances divided into two classes: "hill" and "valley." Each instance has attributes that describe the slope of a hill or valley at various points. There are 100 features in total, with 50 features representing the hill and another 50 representing the valley. The dataset was created in order to distinguish between hills and valleys based on their attributes. The dataset contains no missing values, making it suitable for use in machine learning algorithms and classification tasks. The purpose of this dataset is to study and develop models for hill and valley detection using supervised learning techniques.
