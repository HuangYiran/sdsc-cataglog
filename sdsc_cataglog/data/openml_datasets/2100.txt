name: QSAR-TID-12264
dataset_id: 4086.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12264 is related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for a series of compounds. It contains 8 attributes, including molecular descriptors and experimental bioactivity values, for 41 different compounds. These descriptors consist of features that represent the chemical structure and properties of the compounds, such as molecular weight and topological indices. The bioactivity values indicate the biological activity of the compounds against a specific biological target. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between the chemical structure and biological activity to predict and optimize the bioactivity of new compounds. Its analysis may contribute to drug discovery and development.
