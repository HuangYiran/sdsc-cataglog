name: QSAR-TID-101278
dataset_id: 3989.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101278 consists of 4,278 compounds with 1025 molecular descriptors. The task is to predict the activity of these compounds against a specific biomolecular target. The dataset includes both active and inactive compounds, which are labeled with binary values indicating their activity. The molecular descriptors represent various chemical properties and structural features of the compounds. These descriptors were calculated using various methods, including molecular graphical representations and quantum chemical calculations. The dataset can be used for developing machine learning models to predict the activity of new compounds and aid in drug discovery and design.
