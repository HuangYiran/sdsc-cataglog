name: Within-project-Defect-Prediction-for-Ansible
dataset_id: 43357.0
description: The dataset "Within-project-Defect-Prediction-for-Ansible" consists of a collection of metrics and defect data from a software project using the Ansible automation framework. It includes information from various sources such as code repositories, bug tracking systems, and continuous integration tools. The dataset aims to assist in the development of within-project defect prediction models, which can help identify potential software defects in future releases. The metrics provided in the dataset capture various aspects of the project's code, such as complexity, maintainability, and size. This dataset can be useful for researchers and practitioners working on defect prediction and software quality improvement in Ansible-based projects.
