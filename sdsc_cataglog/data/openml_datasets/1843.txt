name: QSAR-TID-100288
dataset_id: 3828.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100288 contains information about the biological activity of compounds against a specific target. It consists of 960 compounds, each described by 183 molecular descriptors and labeled as active or inactive. The molecular descriptors include information about the compounds' physical and chemical properties, such as their size, shape, and charge distribution. The dataset aims to aid in the development of predictive models to determine the potential biological activity of new compounds. It can be used for machine learning and data mining purposes, allowing researchers to analyze the relationship between molecular properties and activity and make predictions for new, untested compounds.
