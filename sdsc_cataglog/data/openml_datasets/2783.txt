name: Node_Embedding
dataset_id: 42218.0
description: The dataset Node_Embedding contains information about nodes in a graph. It includes features related to each node, such as its id, degree centrality, and clustering coefficient. The dataset also provides node embeddings generated using various techniques. These embeddings represent the learned representations of nodes in a lower-dimensional space. The dataset comprises around 10,000 nodes and includes both numerical and categorical features. Additionally, it is accompanied by a target variable, which indicates the class label associated with each node. This dataset can be used for tasks such as node classification or link prediction in graph-based machine learning algorithms.
