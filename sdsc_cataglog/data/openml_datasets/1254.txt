name: QSAR-TID-10930
dataset_id: 3230.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10930 is used for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds. It contains information about 3,277 chemical compounds and their corresponding toxicity values, measured as the lethal dose required to kill 50% of a test population (LD50). The dataset includes 102 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values representing various characteristics of each compound. These descriptors have been generated using quantum mechanical calculations and other methods. The aim of this dataset is to develop models that can accurately predict the toxicity of new chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset can be of great value for researchers working in the field of drug design and toxicology.
