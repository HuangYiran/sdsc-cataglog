name: QSAR-TID-20113
dataset_id: 3139.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-20113 contains information on the biological activity of molecules towards the toxicity target Tetrahymena pyriformis. It includes a total of 8,497 compounds with 4,032 being active and 4,465 inactive against the target. The chemical structures are represented by molecular fingerprints, while the biological activity is specified as binary values. This dataset aims to aid the development of predictive models that can identify toxic molecules. The molecular fingerprints can be used to analyze and predict the toxicity of new compounds, potentially helping in the identification and elimination of harmful substances early in the drug discovery process.
