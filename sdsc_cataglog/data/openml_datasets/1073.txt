name: QSAR-TID-101506
dataset_id: 3049.0
description: QSAR-TID-101506 is a dataset obtained from the PubChem database and contains information about molecules for use in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies. The dataset consists of 4,951 instances with 1,020 molecular descriptors and one target variable. These descriptors are based on various physicochemical, topological, and electronic properties of the molecules. The target variable represents the toxicity of the molecules, which is expressed as a continuous value. The dataset aims to assist in the development of predictive models and computational tools for toxicity assessment. QSAR-TID-101506 could be a valuable resource for researchers and scientists in the field of drug discovery and chemical hazard assessment.
