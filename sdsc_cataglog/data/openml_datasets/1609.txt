name: QSAR-TID-11056
dataset_id: 3594.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11056 contains chemical and biological properties of compounds that have been tested for their ability to inhibit HIV activity. There are a total of 327 compounds with 10 input features and a target variable indicating the biological activity of the compound. The input features include measures of molecular properties, atom-centered fragments, and topological features. The compounds are divided into active and inactive classes based on their HIV inhibition activity. The dataset aims to aid in the development of predictive models for identifying compounds with potential HIV inhibitory activity.
