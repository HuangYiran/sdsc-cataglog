name: QSAR-TID-10674
dataset_id: 3725.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10674 is a collection of chemical compounds used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. It consists of 1,067 molecules, each represented by 41 physicochemical descriptors. The compounds have been tested for their toxicity towards Tetrahymena pyriformis, a type of protozoa. The activity values obtained from these tests are included in the dataset, providing a quantitative measure of toxicity. The dataset also includes information on the compounds' chemical structures and the standardization level of the data. QSAR-TID-10674 is publicly available and can be used by researchers and scientists for developing predictive models or studying the relationship between molecular features and toxicity.
