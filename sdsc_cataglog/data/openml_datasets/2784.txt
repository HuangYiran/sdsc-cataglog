name: Edge_Embedding
dataset_id: 42220.0
description: Edge_Embedding is a dataset containing information about the embeddings, weights, and attributes of edges in a graph. The dataset consists of several columns, including "source" and "target" referring to the nodes connected by the edge, "embedding" representing the numerical embeddings associated with the edge, and "weight" denoting the weight of the edge. Additionally, the dataset may include other columns representing attributes of the edges. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive source of information to analyze and understand the properties of edges in a graph, enabling various applications such as link prediction and network analysis.
