name: QSAR-TID-12853
dataset_id: 3438.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12853 dataset is concerned with predicting the toxic levels of chemical compounds. It consists of 1311 instances, each representing a unique compound, and nine attributes that characterize each compound's structural and chemical properties. The target variable is a continuous value representing the toxic level. The dataset lacks missing or ambiguous values. The compounds come from diverse chemical classes, making it appropriate for generalizing the model. However, the dataset may require preprocessing, as the attributes are not normalized and have different measurement scales. Given its characteristics, the QSAR-TID-12853 dataset is suitable for developing machine learning models for predicting chemical toxicity.
