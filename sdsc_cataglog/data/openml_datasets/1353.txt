name: QSAR-TID-100851
dataset_id: 3330.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100851 is about the prediction of biological activities of chemical compounds. It contains information on 8,851 compounds, each represented by 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. The compounds are divided into two sets: training and test sets, with 6,140 and 2,711 instances respectively. The dataset includes a target variable indicating the measured biological activity for each compound, ranging from 0 to 100. The goal is to develop predictive models using the provided descriptors to accurately predict the activity of new chemical compounds. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and chemical biology.
