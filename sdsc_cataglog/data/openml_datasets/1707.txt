name: QSAR-TID-10008
dataset_id: 3690.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10008 dataset includes information on the chemical structures and targets of drugs, representing a crucial resource for drug discovery. The dataset features a collection of 8,642 compounds and their corresponding binding affinities for three different protein targets. The compounds are represented by various molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight and solubility, which are vital for predicting their biological activities. This dataset is particularly valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, as it enables researchers to establish connections between chemical characteristics and drug-target interactions. Such models can aid in the design and optimization of new drug candidates, ultimately accelerating the drug discovery process.
