name: kdd_coil_5
dataset_id: 576.0
description: The kdd_coil_5 dataset is used for assessing the performance of classification algorithms in detecting faulty parts in a rolling mill. It consists of 1941 instances with 27 attributes. The target variable indicates whether the steel coil has a defect or not. The dataset is highly imbalanced, where only 48 instances are labeled as defective while the rest are non-defective. The attributes include information on vibration, acceleration, pressure, temperature, and power consumption. The dataset aims to facilitate research in predictive maintenance and fault detection in industrial settings.
