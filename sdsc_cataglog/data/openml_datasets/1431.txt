name: QSAR-TID-100859
dataset_id: 3411.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100859 contains a total of 37 compounds, each having a set of 1024 molecular descriptors. These descriptors were calculated for each compound using various software programs and algorithms. The dataset is focused on predicting acute aquatic toxicity of these compounds. The target variable is the logarithm of the median lethal concentration (LC50), which quantifies the concentration at which 50% of the tested organisms are expected to die. The dataset also includes additional information such as experimental conditions, chemical structures, and their respective CAS numbers. QSAR-TID-100859 can be utilized for developing models that predict toxicity and aid in decision-making processes related to chemical safety.
