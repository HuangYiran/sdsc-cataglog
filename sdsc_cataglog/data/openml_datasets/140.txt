name: SPECTF
dataset_id: 337.0
description: The dataset SPECTF is used for diagnosing lung disorders. It contains 267 instances with 22 attributes, out of which one is a binary class attribute indicating the presence of a specific lung disorder. The remaining 21 attributes represent images of a patient's lungs. Each attribute ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the ratio of pixels classified as abnormal in each image. The dataset is imbalanced, with 55.2% instances being negative (no disorder) and 44.8% positive (disorder present). This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks in machine learning research, particularly in medical diagnosis.
