dataset_id: 42015.0
description: The dataset "iris" is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The flowers are from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset is often used for classification tasks, where the objective is to predict the species of iris based on its features. It is considered an ideal dataset for beginners due to its simplicity and well-defined nature. Various algorithms, such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines, have been applied to this dataset for classification purposes.
