description: The Diabetes dataset in scikit-learn is a widely-used dataset that is focused on diabetes diagnosis. It consists of ten baseline variables, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. The dataset is beneficial for machine learning experiments or regression analyses on diabetes prediction or prognosis. It is often used to evaluate the performance of regression algorithms and compare models' abilities to predict the progression of the disease based on patient characteristics.
