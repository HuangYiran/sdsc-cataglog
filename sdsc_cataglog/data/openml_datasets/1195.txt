name: QSAR-TID-101309
dataset_id: 3171.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101309 dataset contains molecular structures and their corresponding biological activities. It consists of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors, calculated based on the structure of each compound. The dataset provides information on 700 molecular compounds, including their biological activity values, such as inhibition constants. The purpose of this dataset is to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship models, which can predict the biological activity of new molecules based on their structure. The dataset is suitable for machine learning and computational chemistry applications in drug discovery and development fields.
