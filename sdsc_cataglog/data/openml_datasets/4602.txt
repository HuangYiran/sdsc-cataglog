description: The dataset KDDCup99_seed_3_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True has 2,000 rows and 10 classes. It contains 100 columns and is stratified. The dataset is likely part of the KDD Cup 1999 Data competition, which focuses on intrusion detection for network-based attacks. The seed number 3 indicates that the dataset is derived from a particular random seed. Stratification ensures that each class is proportionately represented in the dataset, enhancing the balance between classes. With 100 columns, the dataset likely includes various features related to network traffic and potential attack patterns, making it ideal for training and evaluating intrusion detection models.
