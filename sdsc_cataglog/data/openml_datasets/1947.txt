name: QSAR-TID-10187
dataset_id: 3932.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10187 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds that have been tested for their mutagenic effects on bacteria. There are 7,940 compounds in total, each represented by 41 molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide information about the compounds' structure, shape, and electronic properties. The dataset is used for developing machine learning models to predict the mutagenic activity of new compounds. It has been preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. The goal of this dataset is to aid in the development of computational models for mutagenicity prediction, which can be used to assess the safety of new chemical compounds.
