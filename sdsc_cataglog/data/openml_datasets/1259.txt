name: QSAR-TID-101360
dataset_id: 3235.0
description: QSAR-TID-101360 is a dataset that consists of 1057 chemical compounds with their biological activities against two targets: Tox21 AR agonist and Tox21 ER agonist. Each compound's structure is represented by 2D and 3D molecular descriptors, while the bioactivity values are given as binary outcomes (active or inactive). The dataset is intended for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling, aiming to develop models that can predict the biological activity of unknown compounds based on their molecular structure. Furthermore, the dataset is publicly accessible and can be used by researchers and scientists to advance their studies in chemical and biological research fields.
