name: QSAR-TID-100624
dataset_id: 3270.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100624 contains information about the toxicity of chemical compounds. It comprises a total of 1433 compounds, each represented by various descriptors or features extracted from their molecular structures. These descriptors include constitutional, topological, geometric, electric, and quantum molecular properties. The dataset also includes the toxicity value of each compound, measured as a continuous variable. This dataset is commonly used in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, which aims to predict the toxicity of unknown compounds based on their structural features. The QSAR-TID-100624 dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing computational models to assess toxicity.
