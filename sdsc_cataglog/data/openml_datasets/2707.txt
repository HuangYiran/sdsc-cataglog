name: iris
dataset_id: 42066.0
description: The dataset iris is a well-known dataset for machine learning studies. It consists of measurements of four attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset contains 150 instances evenly distributed among the species, with each instance having 50 samples. It is commonly used for classification tasks and pattern recognition algorithms due to its simplicity and availability. The goal is to use the attributes to accurately classify the iris species. Overall, the iris dataset is a widely used benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms.
