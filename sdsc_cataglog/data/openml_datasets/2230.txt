description: The dataset GAMETES_Epistasis_3-Way_20atts_0.2H_EDM-1_1 is a collection of data used for the purpose of studying epistasis, which is the interaction between multiple genetic factors in determining a specific trait. This dataset specifically focuses on three-way interactions among 20 different attributes. It has a total of 16,000 instances, with each instance representing a set of attributes and a class label indicating the presence or absence of a certain genetic trait. The dataset was generated using a simulated Evolutionary Data Generation Algorithm and is useful for studying and predicting the occurrence of genetic traits influenced by complex interactions between multiple factors.
