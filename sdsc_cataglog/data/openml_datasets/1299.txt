name: QSAR-TID-12944
dataset_id: 3275.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12944 consists of 3,554 chemical structures, each having 1024 molecular descriptors. It was created for modeling and predicting the skin sensitization potential of chemical compounds. The data includes information on experimental results, with a binary classification indicating whether a compound is a sensitizer or a non-sensitizer. The molecular descriptors provide detailed information about the structural and chemical properties of the compounds. The dataset is suitable for the development and evaluation of machine learning models to predict skin sensitization potential. It has been used in previous studies to train models for classification tasks in the field of toxicology and computational chemistry.
