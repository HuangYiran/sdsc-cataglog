description: The dataset "first-order-theorem-proving_seed_4_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True" consists of 2000 rows and 100 columns. It is a first-order theorem proving dataset that was generated with a seed of 4. The dataset is stratified, meaning that the distribution of classes is similar across different subsets of the data. There are 10 different classes in the dataset, which implies that it is a multi-class classification problem. The dataset contains information and features that can be used to train a model for first-order theorem proving and classify instances into one of the ten classes.
