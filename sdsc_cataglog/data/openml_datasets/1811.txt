name: QSAR-TID-10778
dataset_id: 3794.0
description: QSAR-TID-10778 is a dataset comprised of 7,776 chemical compounds with biological activities. The dataset contains 767 positively classified compounds and 7,009 negatively classified compounds. A total of 308 molecular descriptors are available for each compound, which were derived from chemical structures. These descriptors represent features like shape, size, polarity, and topology of the compounds. The dataset is suitable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict biological activities. It can be used for research in drug discovery, molecular biology, and computational chemistry. The dataset is publicly available and can facilitate the development of new prediction models and algorithms.
