name: QSAR-TID-100067
dataset_id: 3057.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100067 consists of information about chemical compounds and their biological activity. It contains 4700 observations and 1024 variables. The dataset is used for drug discovery and toxicity prediction. The variables are a combination of chemical descriptors, such as molecular weight and solubility, and binary features indicating the absence or presence of certain chemical groups. The target variable represents the biological activity of the compounds, classified as "inactive" or "active". The dataset is publicly available and can be used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict the activity of new compounds.
