name: no2
dataset_id: 547.0
description: The dataset no2 contains information about the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in the air. It includes data from various locations and time intervals. The dataset provides measurements of NO2 concentrations, which are recorded in parts per billion (ppb). Additionally, the dataset includes information about the latitude, longitude, and altitude of the measurement locations. The dataset no2 is useful for studying air pollution and analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of NO2 levels. It can be used to identify areas with high NO2 concentrations and track any changes over time, aiding in the development of effective pollution control measures.
