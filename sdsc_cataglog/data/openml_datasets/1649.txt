name: QSAR-TID-10928
dataset_id: 3632.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10928 consists of 4203 compounds with their corresponding molecular descriptors and the biological activities (IC50 values) against a target protein. The compounds are categorized into five classes, representing different levels of activity against the target. The molecular descriptors provide information about the chemical structure and properties of the compounds. The dataset aims to analyze and predict the activity of the compounds based on their molecular features, which can potentially be useful for drug discovery and design. The data can be used for machine learning and modeling approaches to develop predictive models for the target protein's activity.
