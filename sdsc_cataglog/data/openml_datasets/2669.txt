dataset_id: 41983.0
description: The CIFAR-100 dataset is a collection of images divided into 100 fine-grained classes. It has a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is labeled with one of the 100 classes, providing a multi-class classification task. The dataset is meant for studying object recognition and fine-grained visual categorization. The images are of size 32x32 pixels and are color images. The dataset is widely used in the field of computer vision for benchmarking algorithms and models. It provides a challenging task due to the large number of classes and the fine-grained nature of the labels.
