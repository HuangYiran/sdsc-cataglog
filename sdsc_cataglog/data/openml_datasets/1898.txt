name: QSAR-TID-11090
dataset_id: 3883.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11090 consists of 1050 compounds where each compound is classified as either active or inactive against a specific target. The compounds were selected based on their structural diversity to ensure a representative dataset. Physicochemical properties and molecular descriptors of these compounds were calculated using several computational methods. These descriptors include molecular weight, polar surface area, topological charge indices, and others. The dataset also provides information about the biological activity of each compound, including the IC50 value, which represents the concentration required to inhibit the target by 50%. Overall, QSAR-TID-11090 is a valuable resource for developing predictive models for drug discovery research.
