dataset_id: 3745.0
description: QSAR-TID-10684 is a public dataset containing information about different compounds and their biological activity. The dataset consists of 1055 compounds, with each compound having 11 molecular descriptors and a binary outcome indicating its biological activity. The molecular descriptors include features like connectivity, charge, and shape, which provide a representation of the compound's molecular structure. The binary outcome denotes whether the compound is active or inactive in a specific biological assay. This dataset aims to support the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
