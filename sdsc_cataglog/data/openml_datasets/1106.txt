name: QSAR-TID-11694
dataset_id: 3082.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11694 contains information on the biological activities of various molecules. It includes 6,084 instances and 918 attributes. The molecules' activities were assessed based on their ability to inhibit the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, an important target in cancer research. The attributes represent the molecular descriptors, such as the presence of specific chemical groups, which can influence the activity. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activities of novel molecules. QSAR-TID-11694 serves as a valuable resource for the research community working on drug discovery and the design of new anticancer agents.
