name: Glass-Classification
dataset_id: 43750.0
description: The Glass-Classification dataset contains information about various types of glass and their chemical properties. It consists of 214 instances and 10 input attributes, including refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, barium, iron, and class types. There are 6 different types of glass represented in the dataset, categorized as building_windows, vehicle_windows, containers, tableware, headlamps, and other. The dataset aims to predict the glass type based on its chemical composition. It is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for classification algorithms and is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
