name: QSAR-Bioconcentration-classes-dataset
dataset_id: 43581.0
description: QSAR-Bioconcentration-classes-dataset is a collection of 367 chemical compounds labeled with their respective bioconcentration class. The dataset provides detailed information on the physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, solubility, and octanol-water partition coefficient, along with 41 molecular descriptors representing different aspects of chemical structure. The bioconcentration classes include low, intermediate, and high, indicating the concentration levels of the compounds in aquatic organisms. This dataset is commonly used in chemoinformatics and bioinformatics research to develop predictive models for assessing the bioconcentration potential of chemicals and their ecological impact.
