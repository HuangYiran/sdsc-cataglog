name: QSAR-TID-12725
dataset_id: 3141.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12725 dataset consists of 6,513 molecular compounds with their respective biological activities. These compounds are potential inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 integrase enzyme, which is crucial for the virus to replicate. The dataset offers information on the structure of these compounds along with their physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors, and acceptors. Additionally, it includes the experimental activity values of these compounds in inhibiting the HIV-1 integrase enzyme. QSAR-TID-12725 can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activities and aid in the discovery of new potential inhibitors for treating HIV-1 infections.
