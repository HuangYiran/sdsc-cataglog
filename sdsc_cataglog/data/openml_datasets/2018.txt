name: QSAR-TID-100075
dataset_id: 4004.0
description: QSAR-TID-100075 is a dataset consisting of 367 compounds tested for their biological activity against a specific target. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors, such as geometric, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical properties, along with the experimentally measured activity values. The compounds belong to different chemical classes and were tested under controlled conditions. The goal of this dataset is to create quantitative structure-activity relationship models, which can predict the activity of new compounds based on their molecular features. It is a valuable resource for developing computational methods in drug discovery and design. Additional information about the dataset, including its source and methodology, is available for further analysis.
