name: QSAR-TID-11692
dataset_id: 3434.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11692 dataset consists of information about various chemical compounds and their characteristics. The dataset includes 11 numerical attributes representing structural, thermodynamic, and electrochemical properties of the compounds. These attributes are used to predict the binding affinity values of the compounds to a specific target. The dataset contains 1,869 compounds and has been pre-processed to remove missing values and normalize the data. It is suitable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to understand the relationship between the chemical structure and the biological activity of the compounds.
