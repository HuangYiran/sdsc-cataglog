name: QSAR-TID-108
dataset_id: 4115.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-108 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding properties, curated for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. It consists of a total of 108 samples, each with 7 molecular features and an accompanying binary activity label indicating whether the compound is active or inactive against a specific target. The dataset was constructed to investigate the relationship between the structure of the compounds and their activity. It provides valuable information for developing predictive models and understanding the molecular basis of the compound's activity.
