name: QSAR-TID-10696
dataset_id: 4101.0
description: QSAR-TID-10696 is a dataset that contains biological activities of various chemical compounds. It includes information on 70 compounds, with 144 features and one target variable representing their biological activity. The dataset is derived from research experiments conducted on a set of chemical compounds. The compounds were screened for their potential to act on a specific target protein. The features in the dataset represent molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, topological indices, and electronic properties. The dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their chemical properties. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for research purposes.
