name: QSAR-TID-117
dataset_id: 3760.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-117 contains chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activity values. It consists of 155 instances, each with 117 numerical descriptors that represent various properties of the compounds. The dataset is focused on assessing the relationship between the descriptors and the biological activity, specifically the inhibition constant, which measures the ability of a compound to bind to a receptor. The data is useful for developing predictive models and understanding the structure-activity relationships of chemical compounds.
