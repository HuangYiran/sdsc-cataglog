name: QSAR-TID-11736
dataset_id: 3847.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11736 dataset contains information on 204 compounds and their biological activities against a specific target protein. Each compound is represented by 1,166 molecular descriptors that capture its structural and physicochemical properties. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological potency of similar compounds. It includes both active and inactive compounds, where the activity is represented by pIC50 values. The dataset is useful for researchers interested in virtual screening, drug discovery, and computational chemistry as it provides a basis for modeling and predicting the activity of unknown compounds.
