description: The breast-tissue dataset consists of 106 samples of breast tissue with 9 attributes each. It was created to classify various types of breast tissue based on the attributes provided. Each sample is labeled with one of the 6 classes: "carcinoma, fibro-adenoma, fibro-adenosis, lobular carcinoma, mastopathy, and normal". The dataset was obtained through biopsies of breast tissue from patients with confirmed diagnoses. The attributes include thickness, cell size, cell shape, marginal adhesion, epithelial size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses. The breast-tissue dataset holds potential for training classification models in the field of breast cancer diagnosis and research.
