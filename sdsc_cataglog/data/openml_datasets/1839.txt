name: QSAR-TID-10034
dataset_id: 3824.0
description: QSAR-TID-10034 is a dataset containing information on 512 compounds and their quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for detecting estrogen receptor activity. The data was obtained using a range of molecular descriptors, including topological and quantum chemical features. The compounds were divided into two classes based on their activity: active or inactive. The dataset includes parameters such as molecular weight, number of atoms, bond count, and solubility. Additionally, it provides information about the quality of the linear regression models used to predict the activity of the compounds. QSAR-TID-10034 enables researchers to develop and validate models for estimating estrogen receptor activity and exploring related areas of research.
