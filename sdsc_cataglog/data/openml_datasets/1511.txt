name: QSAR-TID-11831
dataset_id: 3494.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11831 dataset contains information on the biological activity of compounds. It consists of 7,209 compounds with 1026 features that define their chemical properties. The dataset also includes a target variable indicating the biological activity of each compound, with values ranging from 0 to 14. The compounds were tested in two different biological assays, resulting in two target variables. The dataset is used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds. It is publicly available for research purposes and can aid in drug discovery and design.
