name: QSAR-TID-20112
dataset_id: 3564.0
description: QSAR-TID-20112 is a dataset used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, specifically for drug-like compounds. It consists of 100 chemical compounds, each represented by 597 molecular descriptors. The molecular descriptors cover a wide range of properties like size, shape, electronic, and thermodynamic factors. The dataset also includes the corresponding activity values, measured as the potency against a biological target of interest. QSAR-TID-20112 is publicly available and has been used to develop predictive models for drug design and toxicity assessment.
