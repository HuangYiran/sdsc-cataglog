description: QSAR-TID-101269 is a dataset consisting of 1473 observations and 74 descriptors. It is used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of chemical compounds. The dataset focuses on determining the toxicity endpoint LC50 (concentration causing 50% mortality) for various compounds. The descriptors include various physicochemical properties, molecular fingerprints, and topological indices. The dataset has been curated and anonymized, removing any identifying information. With this dataset, researchers can explore the relationship between chemical features and toxicity, and build predictive models for toxicity assessment in drug discovery and environmental risk assessment.
