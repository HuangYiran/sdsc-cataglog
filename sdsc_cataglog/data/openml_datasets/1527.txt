name: QSAR-TID-10702
dataset_id: 3511.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10702 consists of chemical compounds used in drug discovery, along with their biological activities. It includes information on 1055 compounds and their corresponding activities against a particular target. The dataset contains 5 input features, which represent the electronically calculated properties of the compounds, and one output feature, which represents the measured biological activity. The input features in this dataset are calculated using the Parzen-Rosenblatt method. This dataset can be utilized for various machine learning tasks, such as regression or classification, to predict the biological activity of new chemical compounds for drug discovery purposes.
