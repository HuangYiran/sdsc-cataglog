name: QSAR-TID-11044
dataset_id: 3155.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11044 consists of 1044 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It was generated to predict the toxicity of compounds based on their molecular structure. The compounds are represented by a set of physicochemical descriptors, including molecular weight, solubility, and presence of specific functional groups. The target variable is the toxicological activity of each compound, which is measured on a scale from -1 to 1. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and studying the relationship between molecular properties and toxicity.
