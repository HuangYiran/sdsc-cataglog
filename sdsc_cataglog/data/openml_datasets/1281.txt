name: QSAR-TID-236
dataset_id: 3257.0
description: The QSAR-TID-236 dataset contains information on the biological activity of 1,439 chemical compounds. The compounds were tested against a target protein, and their biological activity was measured using a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model. The dataset includes various physicochemical properties of the compounds, as well as their bioactivity values. The goal of this dataset is to predict the bioactivity of compounds based on their structural features. This dataset is useful for scientists and researchers studying drug discovery, as it allows for the development and evaluation of QSAR models for predicting the activity of new chemical compounds.
