description: Wisconsin-breast-cancer-cytology-features is a dataset that includes information about 699 samples of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. It contains various features extracted from the cytology of the FNA samples, such as cell size, shape, and adhesion. The dataset also includes a diverse range of classes representing different levels of malignancy, from benign to malignant. However, it is important to note that this dataset is relatively small and the features are not collected via standardized methods.
