name: QSAR-TID-12336
dataset_id: 3408.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12336 is a collection of compounds with their corresponding biological activities. It contains 700 instances, each described by 41 molecular descriptors that capture characteristics of the compounds. The dataset is aimed at predicting the activity of compounds against a specific target protein. The values of the biological activity range from 0.0 to 10.0. It is a regression task, where the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the activity of compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset is publicly available and serves as a resource for researchers in the field of drug discovery and design.
