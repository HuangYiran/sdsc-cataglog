name: QSAR-TID-100579
dataset_id: 3575.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100579 contains information about the biological activity of chemical compounds. It consists of 1055 instances, with each instance representing a different compound. The dataset includes 41 different features that describe the compounds' chemical properties, as well as the target variable that represents their biological activity. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a compound is active or inactive. The dataset is part of the QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) field, which aims to establish correlations between the structure of chemical compounds and their biological activities. It can be useful for developing models to predict the biological activity of new chemical compounds.
