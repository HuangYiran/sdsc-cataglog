name: QSAR-TID-11188
dataset_id: 3710.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11188 is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activity against a certain protein target. The dataset consists of 4,870 compounds and includes information about their structure, physicochemical properties, and the measured activity level. The goal of this dataset is to develop predictive models to estimate the activity of new compounds against the protein target. The dataset has been used in various studies to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms and to explore the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity.
