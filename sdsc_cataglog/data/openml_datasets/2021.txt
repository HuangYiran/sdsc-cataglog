name: QSAR-TID-17147
dataset_id: 4007.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17147 contains information on chemical compounds and their biological activity. Each compound is described by various molecular descriptors, such as electrostatic potential, hydrophobicity, and molecular weight. The dataset includes 575 compounds and their corresponding activity values, indicating their effectiveness against a specific target. The goal is to predict the activity of unknown compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and understanding the relationships between compound structure and biological activity, which can aid in drug discovery and development processes.
