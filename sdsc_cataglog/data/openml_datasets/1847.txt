name: QSAR-TID-102667
dataset_id: 3832.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102667 consists of 1055 chemical compounds, which have been tested for their biological activity. The compounds are categorized into two classes - active and inactive. Various molecular descriptors, such as the number of atoms, bond count, and molecular weight, are provided for each compound. Additionally, the dataset contains the values of the biological activity or toxicity for each compound. The goal of this dataset is to develop a model to predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. It can be useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and toxicology.
