description: The dataset yeast_seed_3_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True contains 2000 rows with 10 classes and 100 columns. The dataset is stratified, meaning it maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. This dataset is likely used for classification tasks, where the goal is to assign a class label to each instance based on the values of the 100 features. The presence of 10 classes suggests that the dataset may involve multiple categories or classes, and the stratification ensures that the training and testing data maintain the same class distribution for more accurate evaluation.
