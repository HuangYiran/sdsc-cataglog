name: QSAR-TID-12863
dataset_id: 3128.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12863 contains information on the biological activity of various compounds. It consists of 12863 examples with 7 attributes, including structural properties and molecular features. The dataset aims to predict skin sensitization for the compounds, which is an important aspect in drug development and chemical safety assessment. The compounds were labeled as either "active" or "inactive" based on experimental evaluations. The dataset can be used to develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to accurately classify compounds as sensitizers or non-sensitizers, aiding in the identification of potential hazards in chemicals and helping in the design of safer drugs.
