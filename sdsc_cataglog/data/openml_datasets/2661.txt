name: Indian_pines
dataset_id: 41972.0
description: Indian_pines is a widely used hyperspectral dataset in the remote sensing community. It was collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor over an agricultural area in Indiana, USA. The dataset consists of 145x145 pixels and contains 224 spectral bands. Each pixel represents a small fraction of land surface and has a corresponding spectral signature. The dataset provides valuable information for studying various aspects of hyperspectral analysis, such as data processing, classification, and feature extraction. It has been utilized for developing and testing algorithms in the field of remote sensing and plays a crucial role in advancing the understanding of hyperspectral data analysis techniques.
