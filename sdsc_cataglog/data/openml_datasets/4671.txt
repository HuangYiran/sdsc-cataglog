description: The dataset credit comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes information about credit-worthy consumers. It consists of 30,000 instances with 24 attributes. The data is divided into two sets: the training set with 20,000 instances and the test set with 10,000 instances. The attributes cover various aspects of a consumer's profile, including demographic information, credit history, and financial records. The goal of this dataset is to predict whether a consumer is credit-worthy or not based on these attributes. The dataset poses a binary classification problem and can be used for training and evaluating credit scoring models.
