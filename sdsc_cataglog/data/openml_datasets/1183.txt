name: QSAR-TID-20020
dataset_id: 3159.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-20020 consists of 4,000 compounds. It was created to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds. Each compound is represented by molecular descriptors and an experimental toxicity value. The dataset is divided into 3 subsets: training, validation, and test, containing 3,000, 500, and 500 compounds respectively. The molecular descriptors include 387 attributes, which were calculated based on the chemical structure of each compound. The toxicity values range from 0 to 4 and are based on experimental data. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate toxicity prediction models.
