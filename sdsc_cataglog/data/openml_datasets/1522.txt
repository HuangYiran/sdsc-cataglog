name: QSAR-TID-249
dataset_id: 3505.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-249 is a collection of 249 chemical compounds with corresponding toxicity values. The compounds belong to different chemical classes and were selected based on their potential for use in drug development. The toxicity values were determined through in vitro tests and represent the compounds' ability to cause adverse effects on living organisms. The dataset also includes various physicochemical properties of the compounds, such as molecular weight, solubility, and hydrophobicity. This dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the toxicity of new compounds based on their chemical properties.
