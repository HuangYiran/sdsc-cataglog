name: QSAR-TID-101301
dataset_id: 4105.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101301 is a collection of chemical compounds that have been tested for their potential toxicity to certain organisms. It consists of 312 compounds with 1024 molecular descriptors. The aim of the dataset is to predict the toxicity of new compounds based on the molecular properties. The toxicity values are represented by continuous variables ranging from 0 to 1. The dataset is widely used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to understand the relationship between chemical structure and toxicity. It provides valuable information for researchers in drug discovery and environmental risk assessment.
