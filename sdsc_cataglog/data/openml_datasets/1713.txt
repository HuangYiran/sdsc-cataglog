name: QSAR-TID-11842
dataset_id: 3696.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11842 dataset consists of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. The dataset contains 6,120 instances and 5 attributes including two molecular descriptors, a binary classification value, an activity outcome, and an experimental outcome. The molecular descriptors describe the molecular properties of the compounds while the activity outcome represents the biological activity. The experimental outcome determines whether the experiment to measure the biological activity was successful or unsuccessful. The dataset is intended for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict biological activities of chemical compounds based on their molecular properties.
