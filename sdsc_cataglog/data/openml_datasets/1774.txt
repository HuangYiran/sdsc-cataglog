name: QSAR-TID-11639
dataset_id: 3757.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11639 consists of a total of 422 molecular structures, each associated with their corresponding experimental inhibitory activity values against a specific target protein. The molecular structures contain 1024 molecular descriptor values, which include information about various physicochemical properties, such as shape, size, electrostatic potential, and hydrophobicity. The dataset also provides information about the target protein's structural features and its biological activity. The purpose of this dataset is to analyze and predict the inhibitory activity of molecules against the target protein using machine learning techniques.
