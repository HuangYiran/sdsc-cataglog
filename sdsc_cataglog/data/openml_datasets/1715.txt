name: QSAR-TID-12793
dataset_id: 3698.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12793 contains information about 1,790 chemical compounds. It includes data on the compounds' molecular structures and their associated biological activities. The dataset was created for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular features. The dataset also includes information about the compounds' toxicity levels and experimental conditions. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the field of drug discovery and chemical biology, enabling the development of predictive models for identifying potentially active compounds.
