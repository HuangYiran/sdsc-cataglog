name: QSAR-TID-219
dataset_id: 3259.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-219 involves a collection of 74 compounds with their quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) values. It contains information on the compounds' chemical properties and their corresponding biological activities. The dataset aims to predict the compounds' half-life values, which are indicators of their persistence and potential environmental impact. The data are stored in a 219-variable matrix, including descriptors such as atom connectivity indices, topological and geometrical descriptors, and Kier&Hall connectivity indices. This dataset is valuable for researchers and scientists working in the field of chemoinformatics and environmental chemistry, aiding in the assessment of chemical compounds' potential risks.
