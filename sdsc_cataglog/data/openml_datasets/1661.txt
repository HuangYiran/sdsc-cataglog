dataset_id: 3644.0
description: QSAR-TID-101610 dataset contains 1055 chemical compounds presented in SMILES format, along with their bioactivity data related to inhibitory concentration (IC50) levels against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite causing Chagas disease. The compounds were subjected to molecular docking simulations, and their interaction energies with the target protein were assessed. Various molecular descriptors, including constitutional, topological, and physicochemical properties, were calculated for each compound. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the IC50 values of similar compounds. It can be useful for researchers working on drug discovery, lead optimization, and virtual screening for Chagas disease treatment.
