name: QSAR-TID-12366
dataset_id: 3247.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12366 is a collection of chemical compounds with known toxic effects on HepG2 cell lines, which are liver cells. The compounds were used in high-throughput screening to determine their potential toxicity. The dataset includes various descriptors of the compounds, such as molecular weight, logP, and topological indices. It also provides information on the toxic effects, such as cell viability and cytotoxicity. The goal of this dataset is to predict the toxicity of new compounds based on their descriptors. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for developing QSAR models to assess the toxic potential of chemicals.
