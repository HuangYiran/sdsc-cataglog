name: QSAR-TID-30002
dataset_id: 3530.0
description: The QSAR-TID-30002 dataset is a collection of chemical and molecular properties of 3,000 molecules. It is designed for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The dataset includes various descriptors such as topological, geometric, constitutional, and electronic factors, along with the TID (Toxicity Indicator) values. The TID values represent the potential toxicity of the molecules. These descriptors and TID values can be utilized to train machine learning algorithms for predicting toxicity of similar molecules. Researchers and scientists can use this dataset to explore the relationship between molecular properties and toxicity, assisting in the development of safer chemicals and drugs.
