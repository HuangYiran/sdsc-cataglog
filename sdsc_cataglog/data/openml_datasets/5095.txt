name: friedman1
dataset_id: 45636.0
description: The dataset called friedman1 consists of 1000 observations and 10 features. It is commonly used to train regression models to predict the value of a dependent variable. The variables in the dataset are generated using the Friedman #1 regression equation, which involves non-linear functions. The target variable is formed as the sum of sine terms, while the features are randomly generated from uniform distributions. The dataset aims to mimic real-world scenarios where multiple independent variables affect the outcome. It is often used for benchmarking and evaluating the performance of regression algorithms.
