name: QSAR-TID-10618
dataset_id: 3899.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10618 is related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study of chemical compounds. It consists of 5,574 instances, each containing 10 molecular descriptors and an activity response. The molecular descriptors include characteristics like logP, molecular weight, and topological polar surface area. The activity response is a numerical value representing the inhibitory activity of the compounds against a specific molecular target. The dataset's objective is to develop a predictive model to estimate the inhibitory activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. It can be used for machine learning and data mining tasks related to QSAR studies.
