dataset_id: 3702.0
description: QSAR-TID-101130 is a dataset containing information about 960 substances used to predict toxicity. Each substance has 2D and 3D molecular descriptors, while their toxicity is measured through EC50 values. The dataset also includes a binary classification of substances into toxic and non-toxic categories. All substances were tested on the same organism to maintain consistency. The dataset has potential applications in drug discovery and environmental studies, as it provides valuable insights into the relationship between molecular structure and toxicity. However, the dataset comes with some limitations, such as missing values and some redundant descriptors, which need to be addressed before analysis.
