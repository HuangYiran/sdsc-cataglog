name: first-order-theorem-proving
dataset_id: 1475.0
description: The dataset "first-order-theorem-proving" contains preprocessed first-order logic problems and their corresponding theorem-proving solutions. It consists of both successful and unsuccessful proofs, allowing for training and evaluation of first-order theorem provers. The dataset is partitioned into three subsets: training, development, and testing. It provides a diverse range of problem domains, including arithmetic, algebra, data structures, and program verification. Each problem in the dataset is represented in a structured format using a combination of standard logic operators and symbols. The dataset aims to facilitate research and development in the field of automated theorem proving for first-order logic.
