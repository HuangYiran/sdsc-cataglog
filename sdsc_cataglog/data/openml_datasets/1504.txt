name: QSAR-TID-100962
dataset_id: 3487.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100962 is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, which aims to predict the biological activity of chemical compounds based on their structural properties. The dataset consists of 120 compounds, each characterized by 241 molecular descriptors, including topological, electrostatic, and shape-related properties. The biological activity is represented by IC50 values, which measure the concentration required to inhibit 50% of a target enzyme's activity. The dataset focuses on chemical compounds that have potential antimalarial activity, making it valuable for drug discovery and development in the field of malaria research. QSAR modeling using this dataset can aid in identifying new compounds with improved antimalarial effects.
