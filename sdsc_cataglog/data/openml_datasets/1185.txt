name: QSAR-TID-10929
dataset_id: 3161.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10929 is a collection of chemical compounds along with their biological activities. It consists of 1,508 samples with 1026 molecular descriptors. The compounds in the dataset are split into three classes based on their activity: active, intermediate, and inactive. The dataset is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, which aims to predict the biological response of a compound based on its structural properties. It can be used by researchers to develop models and algorithms for drug discovery and optimization. The dataset provides an opportunity to study the relationship between chemical structures and biological activities.
