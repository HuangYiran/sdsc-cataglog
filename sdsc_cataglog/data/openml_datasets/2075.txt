name: QSAR-TID-11287
dataset_id: 4061.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11287 dataset is a collection of 4,851 small organic molecules, each represented by 529 molecular descriptors. These molecular descriptors provide information about the structural, energetic, and electronic properties of the molecules. The dataset also includes the measured toxic endpoint of each molecule, which indicates its potential toxicity. The toxic endpoint is represented by a continuous variable, and the values range from 0.14 to 8.4. The dataset is suitable for use in developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of small organic molecules based on their molecular descriptors.
