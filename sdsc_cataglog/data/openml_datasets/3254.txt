description: The HMEQ_Data dataset is commonly used in credit scoring analysis. It consists of 5,960 observations and 13 variables. The target variable is "BAD," representing credit defaults. The other variables include a mix of binary and continuous variables related to factors such as loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, credit scores, and past delinquencies. The dataset helps analyze the performance of credit scoring models in predicting whether a loan applicant will default or not. It serves as a valuable resource for evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of credit risk models and their ability to identify default risk accurately.
