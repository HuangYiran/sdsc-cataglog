name: higgs
dataset_id: 4532.0
description: The Higgs dataset is a collection of experimental measurements with the goal of identifying the fundamental particle known as the Higgs boson. The dataset is based on a large-scale physics experiment conducted at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. It contains various features such as energy, momentum, and specific properties that characterize the event. The dataset is labeled, with a binary classification task of determining whether a given event represents a Higgs boson or background noise. The dataset also includes both simulated signal and background events, making it suitable for training and testing machine learning models to accurately identify the Higgs boson.
