description: The KDDCup09-Appetency dataset is a collection of data related to customer behavior and demographics, gathered for a data mining competition. The dataset consists of 76,020 instances and 77 attributes, including features such as customer age, income, and purchase history. The goal of the competition was to develop a model that could predict customer appetency, or the likelihood of a customer being interested in a new product. The dataset is unique, as it contains a high proportion of positive instances (i.e., customers showing appetency) compared to negative instances. The dataset can be used for developing predictive models and analyzing customer behavior in relation to product appetency.
