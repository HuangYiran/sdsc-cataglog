name: AP_Endometrium_Omentum
dataset_id: 1151.0
description: The dataset AP_Endometrium_Omentum contains molecular profiling data from 222 endometrial carcinoma patients. The data includes gene expression levels, DNA copy number changes, and DNA methylation profiles. The patients were classified into four subgroups based on their molecular profiles. The dataset also includes clinical information such as age, tumor grade, and stage. The purpose of this dataset is to identify molecular signatures that can differentiate different subgroups and to explore potential biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response in endometrial carcinoma. The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers studying this cancer type and may contribute to the development of personalized therapies.
