name: QSAR-TID-30037
dataset_id: 3917.0
description: The QSAR-TID-30037 dataset is a collection of 900 drug-like compounds used for drug discovery and design. Each compound is described by 1712 molecular descriptors that represent different physiochemical properties. These descriptors include molecular weight, hydrogen bond count, and topological features. The dataset also provides the corresponding activity values of the compounds, which indicate their effectiveness in inhibiting a specific target protein. The goal is to analyze the relationship between the molecular descriptors and the compound activity values to predict the activity of new compounds. This dataset can be useful for researchers in drug development and computational chemistry.
