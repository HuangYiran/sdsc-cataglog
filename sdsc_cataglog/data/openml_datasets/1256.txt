name: QSAR-TID-102988
dataset_id: 3232.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102988 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It contains information on 1029 compounds and 41 descriptive molecular attributes. The dataset was created to analyze and predict the potency of compounds as inhibitors of thrombin, an enzyme responsible for blood clotting. Each compound is labeled with its respective activity value, indicating its effectiveness as a thrombin inhibitor. The dataset aims to aid in the development of machine learning models for virtual screening and drug design, potentially facilitating the discovery of new thrombin inhibitors for medical purposes.
