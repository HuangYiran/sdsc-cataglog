name: QSAR-TID-17106
dataset_id: 3045.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17106 contains information on the toxicity of various compounds. It consists of 4,514 chemical compounds with corresponding toxicity values, measured as the concentration needed to inhibit cell growth by 50%. The compounds have 574 physicochemical descriptors, including molecular weight, surface area, and polarizability. The dataset aims to predict the toxic potency of new compounds based on their physicochemical properties. The dataset is commonly used for developing machine learning models and evaluating their performance in predicting toxicity. However, it is worth noting that the dataset may have some limitations, such as missing values and potential biases.
