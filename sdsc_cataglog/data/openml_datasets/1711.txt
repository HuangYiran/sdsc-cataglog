description: The QSAR-TID-10466 dataset is a collection of molecular descriptors and biological activities of benzodiazepine compounds. The dataset consists of 4,466 samples with 1,005 molecular features and a binary label indicating the biological activity (active or inactive) of the compounds. The compounds were obtained from the ZINC database and were split into training and test sets with a ratio of 3:1. The generated molecular descriptors include physicochemical, topological, electronic, and geometric features. The dataset aims to provide a resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and predicting the biological activity of benzodiazepines.
