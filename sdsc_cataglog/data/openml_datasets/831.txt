name: lymphoma_9classes
dataset_id: 1102.0
description: The dataset lymphoma_9classes consists of gene expression data from nine different classes of lymphoma tumors. It includes 62 samples with each sample having 7071 features. The goal is to classify the samples based on gene expression levels. The dataset contains various types of lymphomas such as B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Feature selection has already been performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The dataset can be used for classification tasks such as building machine learning models to predict the type of lymphoma based on gene expression patterns, aiding in diagnosis and treatment decisions.
