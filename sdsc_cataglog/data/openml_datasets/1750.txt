name: QSAR-TID-11622
dataset_id: 3733.0
description: QSAR-TID-11622 is a dataset containing biochemical data related to drug molecules and their properties. It consists of 2,428 instances and 5 input features. The target variable is the mutagenic activity of the molecules, represented by a binary classification: mutagenic or non-mutagenic. The dataset includes a wide variety of molecules with different structures and chemical characteristics. It serves as a resource for developing prediction models to determine the mutagenicity of drug compounds. The dataset's availability supports research in drug discovery and computational toxicology by providing a standardized and well-documented set of data for analysis and building machine learning models.
