name: Click_prediction_small
dataset_id: 42733.0
description: The Click_prediction_small dataset contains information about clicks on online advertisements. It includes various features such as ad identifier, advertiser identifier, publisher identifier, ad category, and userâ€™s demographic information. The dataset provides details on both positive and negative instances of clicks, with negative instances representing non-clicked impressions. The data is highly imbalanced, with only a small fraction of instances being positive clicks. It is suitable for tasks such as click prediction and user behavior analysis. However, due to its small size, it may not be representative of larger datasets and may require preprocessing techniques to handle its class imbalance.
