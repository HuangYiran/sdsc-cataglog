name: QSAR-TID-100427
dataset_id: 3390.0
description: QSAR-TID-100427 is a dataset consisting of 1055 compounds with their corresponding biological activity measured against the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The dataset contains information on the physicochemical properties of the compounds such as molecular descriptors, molecular fingerprints, and heteroatoms. The compounds were classified into two classes, active and inactive, based on their biological activity against the parasite. The dataset aims to be used for the development and evaluation of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the activity of compounds against Trypanosoma cruzi. This dataset can be valuable for researchers working on drug discovery for Chagas disease.
