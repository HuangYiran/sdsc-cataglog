dataset_id: 3782.0
description: QSAR-TID-100429 is a dataset comprising 1053 observations of chemical properties intended for quantifying the toxicity of molecules. Each observation consists of 812 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values that characterize the properties of molecules. The dataset also includes a target variable indicating the toxicological activity of the molecules, represented by binary values of either active or inactive. The data was collected using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, a computational approach that relates chemical structure to biological activity. This dataset is valuable for developing predictive models to determine the toxicity of molecules, aiding in drug discovery and safety assessment.
