name: QSAR-TID-11004
dataset_id: 3133.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11004 contains information on the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of chemicals. It consists of 4,390 compounds with their corresponding BCF values. The compounds are represented by 1024 molecular descriptors, which include features like topological, geometric, and electronic properties. The BCF values in the dataset range from 0.012 to 7,159,000. This dataset can be used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the BCF of new chemicals based on their molecular descriptors. The aim is to aid in the assessment of potential environmental risks and guide decision-making in chemical research and development processes.
