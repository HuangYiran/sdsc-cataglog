name: QSAR-TID-30027
dataset_id: 4023.0
description: QSAR-TID-30027 is a dataset that comprises 556 different chemical compounds. The dataset includes quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data for these compounds, which is valuable for predicting their biological activities. Each compound has 41 different descriptors, such as topological, geometric, and electronic parameters, which characterize their structural properties. Additionally, this dataset provides information about the biological activity of each compound, specifically their inhibitory concentration values (IC50) against the enzyme thymidine kinase 1 (TK1). This dataset is useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of drug discovery, as it enables the development of predictive models for evaluating the potential activity of new compounds.
