name: QSAR-TID-12591
dataset_id: 3314.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12591 is a comprehensive collection of physicochemical properties and bioactivity values related to a set of molecules. It consists of 5,041 instances with 828 attributes, including molecular descriptors such as atom count and bond count, as well as bioactivity values for three different target proteins. The dataset was created for the purpose of developing models to predict the potency of molecules against these target proteins. It has been extensively used in the field of chemoinformatics for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms. The dataset is publicly available and provides a valuable resource for researchers in drug discovery and design.
