name: QSAR-TID-104260
dataset_id: 3463.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-104260 contains 1056 chemical compounds with their corresponding 5 biological activities. This dataset has been collected to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model, which aims to predict the biological activity of a compound based on its structural properties. The dataset includes diverse compounds with different structural features. Each compound is represented by several descriptor variables, such as molecular weight, surface area, and solubility. The biological activities are represented by continuous values ranging from 0 to 9. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for QSAR modeling and related research purposes.
