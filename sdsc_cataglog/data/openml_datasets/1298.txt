name: QSAR-TID-12867
dataset_id: 3274.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12867 contains chemical compounds and their corresponding quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) values. It includes data on 1677 compounds, each with 1024 molecular descriptors and an experimental bioactivity value. The compounds belong to three classes: active, moderately active, and inactive. The dataset aims to predict the bioactivity of new compounds based on their molecular structures. It can be used for classification or regression tasks in drug discovery and computational chemistry. The dataset may be useful for developing models that can identify potential drug candidates based on their chemical properties and activity levels.
