name: Gender-Recognition-by-Voice
dataset_id: 43437.0
description: The dataset "Gender-Recognition-by-Voice" contains voice recordings of individuals along with corresponding gender labels, which are classified as male or female. The dataset was created by collecting voice samples from various speakers and extracting features from the signals, such as acoustic properties and vocal characteristics. These features include frequency measures, nonlinear features, and spectrograms. The aim of this dataset is to aid in gender recognition tasks using machine learning algorithms. It can be utilized by researchers and practitioners to develop gender recognition models and explore the relationship between acoustic features and gender. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed to advance gender recognition technology.
