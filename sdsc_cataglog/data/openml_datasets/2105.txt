name: QSAR-TID-10647
dataset_id: 4091.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10647 includes a total of 1055 compounds which are divided into two classes; active and inactive. The compounds were tested against a specific target protein in order to evaluate their effectiveness as potential drugs. It contains 41 molecular descriptors which were calculated for each compound, providing information about their structural and chemical properties. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the activity of new compounds on the target protein. QSAR-TID-10647 is freely available and can be utilized for classification or regression tasks in drug discovery research.
