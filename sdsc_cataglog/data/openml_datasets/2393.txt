name: Diabetes(scikit-learn)
dataset_id: 41517.0
description: The Diabetes dataset in scikit-learn is a well-known dataset that consists of 442 samples, each with 10 features. It aims to predict the progression of diabetes based on various input variables such as age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and various blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. This dataset is commonly used for regression tasks and is widely utilized for developing machine learning models to predict diabetes progression. It has been extensively studied and serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of regression algorithms.
