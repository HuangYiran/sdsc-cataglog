name: QSAR-TID-100414
dataset_id: 3922.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100414 contains information about the effectiveness of various compounds in inhibiting a specific enzyme. It consists of 367 compounds, with 1024 molecular descriptors for each compound. The target variable is the logarithm of the inhibition constant, a measure of how strongly a compound inhibits the enzyme. The dataset includes compounds with widely varying inhibition constants, ranging from 0.000036 to 7.5. The descriptors cover various chemical properties and structural features of the compounds, providing a comprehensive understanding of their inhibitory potential. This dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds.
