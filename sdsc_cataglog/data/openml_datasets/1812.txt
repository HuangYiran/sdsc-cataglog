name: QSAR-TID-14073
dataset_id: 3795.0
description: The QSAR-TID-14073 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding toxicities, curated for use in toxicity prediction models. The dataset contains 1,407 compounds, each described by 1024 molecular fingerprints, representing their structural properties. The toxicity of these compounds is measured by the logarithm of the reciprocal of their half maximal inhibitory concentration (log(1/IC50)). This quantitative measure allows for accurate prediction of whether a compound will exhibit toxicity. The dataset is widely used in chemoinformatics and computational toxicology research to develop predictive models for toxicology assessment of new compounds.
