name: QSAR-TID-10773
dataset_id: 4076.0
description: QSAR-TID-10773 is a dataset that contains information on 7,742 chemical compounds with their corresponding toxicity values. It focuses on quantifying the potential hazards of different chemical molecules. The dataset features 151 descriptor variables, which are numerical parameters that describe the structural, electronic, and energetic properties of the compounds. The toxicity values were determined using in vitro tests such as murine local lymph node assay or guinea pig maximization test. This dataset can be utilized in developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of unknown chemicals, aiding in the assessment of potential risks associated with certain chemical structures.
