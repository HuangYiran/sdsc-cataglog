name: QSAR-TID-100868
dataset_id: 3543.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100868 is composed of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It contains 1,046 rows and 13 columns, with the first column representing a unique identifier for each compound. The other columns include various molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties of the compounds. The biological activity of each compound is measured as IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) against the enzyme tyrosinase. The dataset was compiled and curated for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of similar compounds against tyrosinase. It can be used for molecular modeling and drug discovery research.
