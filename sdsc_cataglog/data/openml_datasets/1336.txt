name: QSAR-TID-102389
dataset_id: 3313.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102389 contains information about the toxicity of certain compounds. It consists of 607 compounds, each described by 1024 binary attributes representing different chemical properties. The dataset also includes the measured logarithm of the toxicity to rats. The compounds were randomly divided into training and test sets of 523 and 84 compounds, respectively. The goal is to use this dataset to build predictive models that can estimate the toxicity of unknown compounds based on their chemical properties. The QSAR-TID-102389 dataset provides valuable data for research on toxicology and the development of computational models for toxicity prediction.
