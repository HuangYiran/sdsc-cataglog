name: QSAR-TID-103081
dataset_id: 3884.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103081 is used for modeling the toxic effect of various chemicals on daphnia. The dataset consists of 5097 chemical compounds, each represented by 888 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. The objective of this dataset is to develop an accurate quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict the toxicity of unknown compounds. The dataset includes information on the observed toxicity values of the compounds, allowing for the training and evaluation of machine learning models. The dataset is publicly available and can be used by researchers and scientists for toxicity prediction studies and drug design.
