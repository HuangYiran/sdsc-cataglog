name: QSAR-TID-12227
dataset_id: 3488.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12227 dataset contains information about the toxicity of various chemicals. It includes data on 8 different molecular descriptors of the chemicals and their corresponding toxicities, measured as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. The dataset aims to predict the toxicity of new chemicals based on their molecular descriptors using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The data is derived from experiments with human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This dataset is useful for building predictive models and understanding the relationship between molecular structure and toxicity, potentially aiding in the development of safer chemicals.
