name: QSAR-TID-12078
dataset_id: 3107.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12078 dataset comprises information on the biological activity of chemical compounds. It consists of 7,224 compounds classified into two classes: active and inactive. The dataset includes 527 molecular descriptors, such as electronic, geometrical, and topological properties, which are useful to predict the compounds' activity. Some descriptors also represent 2D autocorrelation and binary fingerprints. This dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and predicting the biological activity of chemical compounds. It provides comprehensive information and an appropriate resource for researchers and professionals working in the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery.
