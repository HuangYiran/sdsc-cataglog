name: QSAR-TID-10244
dataset_id: 3346.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10244 contains information about 1247 organic molecules and their biological activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It includes 1024 molecular descriptors that were calculated using the Dragon software. These descriptors provide information about the physicochemical properties and structural characteristics of the molecules. The dataset also contains the binary outcome variable representing the activity of the molecules (active or inactive) against the virus. The dataset was created to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the activity of new molecules against HIV.
