name: fake_det
dataset_id: 42430.0
description: The dataset "fake_det" contains annotated examples of fake and authentic image pairs used for the task of image forgery detection. It consists of 10,000 image pairs, each containing one authentic image and one fake image created using a variety of manipulation techniques. The annotations provide information about the type of manipulation applied, such as adding objects, removing objects, or tampering with the image content. The dataset aims to facilitate research and development of effective image forgery detection algorithms, allowing researchers to train machine learning models and evaluate their performance on a diverse set of fake and authentic images.
