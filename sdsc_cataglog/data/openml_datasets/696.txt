name: molecular-biology_promoters
dataset_id: 956.0
description: The molecular-biology_promoters dataset contains sequences of DNA regions from genes that function as promoters, which initiate the process of gene expression. Each sequence is represented by a string of characters. The dataset consists of 106 instances, with each instance having 57 attributes. There are two classes in the dataset, denoted as '+' and '-', which indicate whether a sequence is a promoter or a non-promoter, respectively. The dataset was gathered from scientific literature and computational biology research. Its purpose is to facilitate the development of algorithms and models that can accurately classify DNA sequences as promoters or non-promoters, hence aiding in genetic research and understanding gene regulation.
