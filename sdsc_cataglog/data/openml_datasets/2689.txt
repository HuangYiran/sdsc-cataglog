dataset_id: 42026.0
description: The iris dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—for three different species of iris flowers—setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples per species. The measurements are in centimeters and provide information about the size and shape of the iris flowers. This dataset is frequently used for classification tasks, as it is considered a good example for exploring different machine learning algorithms and techniques due to its simplicity and well-defined classes.
