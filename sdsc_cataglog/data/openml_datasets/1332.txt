name: QSAR-TID-10938
dataset_id: 3308.0
description: QSAR-TID-10938 is a dataset containing information about chemicals' biological activity towards particular targets. It comprises 1525 compounds with 374 molecular descriptors, including physicochemical, topological, and quantum chemical properties. The aim is to predict the compounds' affinity towards the target using the provided descriptors. The dataset is divided into a training set of 1478 compounds and a test set of 47 compounds. The dependent variable is a continuous value indicating the compounds' activity. The dataset is publicly available and enables researchers to develop models for drug discovery and design, offering valuable insights into chemical properties and their effects on bioactivity.
