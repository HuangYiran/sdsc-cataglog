name: QSAR-TID-10529
dataset_id: 3749.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10529 provides information on the biological activity of chemical compounds. It contains 10529 instances and 249 attributes, including 248 molecular descriptors and a binary class for activity prediction. The molecular descriptors represent various properties of the compounds, such as size, shape, and electronic structure. The binary class indicates whether each compound is active or inactive. The dataset was developed for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, which aims to predict the activity of new chemical compounds based on their structural characteristics. QSAR-TID-10529 serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and computational chemistry.
