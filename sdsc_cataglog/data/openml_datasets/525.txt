name: bodyfat
dataset_id: 778.0
description: The dataset bodyfat contains measurements of body fat percentage and various body circumference measurements for 252 men, along with their age, weight, height, and various skinfold thickness measurements. The goal of the dataset is to develop a mathematical model that can accurately predict body fat using the given features. The data was collected from 1972 to 1974 on healthy men aged 22 to 81 years. The dataset has 15 variables in total, including the target variable - the percentage of body fat. This dataset can be used for regression analysis and modeling related to body fat prediction.
