name: QSAR-TID-10625
dataset_id: 4022.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10625 consists of 3,842 compounds with their biological activity values. The compounds are structurally diverse and were tested against a specific protein target. The biological activity values represent the potency of each compound in inhibiting the protein. The dataset also includes additional information about the compounds, such as their molecular weight, polar surface area, and number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These properties provide insight into the chemical characteristics of the compounds. The dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds.
