dataset_id: 44397.0
description: The dataset named MagicTelescope_seed_0_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True contains 2000 rows and 100 columns, with 10 different classes. It is stratified, meaning that the distribution of the classes is proportional. This dataset is likely related to telescopic observations or magic detection. It seems to have been created for machine learning purposes, as 10 classes can be used for classification tasks. The seed value of 0 suggests that the dataset was randomly generated, and the number of rows and columns indicates a moderate dataset size that can be used for analysis or training machine learning models.
