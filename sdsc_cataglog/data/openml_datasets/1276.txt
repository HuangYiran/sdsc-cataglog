description: QSAR-TID-100858 is a dataset containing molecular descriptors and the activity of chemical compounds against the HIV-1 virus. The dataset consists of 4,209 compounds with numeric activity values, gender descriptors, and 13 molecular descriptors. The activity values were measured using the inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) against HIV-1 protease. The gender descriptors categorize compounds as either "male" or "female." The molecular descriptors include properties like logP, molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors, and acceptors. The dataset aims to study the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) between the molecular descriptors and the activity against HIV-1, potentially aiding in the development of new drugs for the virus.
