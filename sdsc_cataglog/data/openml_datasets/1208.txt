name: QSAR-TID-10116
dataset_id: 3184.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10116 is a collection of chemical compounds with 1057 instances and seven attributes, including three-dimensional structures, descriptors, and bioactivity values against an enzyme target. It aims to predict the activity of the compounds based on their chemical features. The dataset includes both active and inactive compounds, with the majority being inactive. The compounds were randomly selected to ensure a diverse representation. While some attributes are numerical, others are categorical, such as the presence of certain chemical substructures. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for developing predictive models and exploring the relationship between chemical structures and bioactivity.
