name: QSAR-TID-101340
dataset_id: 3548.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101340 contains a total of 74 compounds. Each compound has been labeled as either active or inactive against a specific receptor. Several molecular descriptors have been calculated for each compound, including physicochemical properties and 2D autocorrelation values. The compound structures are represented using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation. The dataset serves as a useful resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and predicting the activity of compounds against the receptor. However, it is important to note that the dataset may contain some noise and uncertainties, so proper preprocessing and analysis techniques are required for reliable results.
