name: QSAR-TID-243
dataset_id: 3963.0
description: QSAR-TID-243 is a dataset consisting of 243 compounds with their corresponding Ames mutagenicity activity. The compounds are classified into two classes: active and inactive. The dataset contains various chemical descriptors that describe the compounds' physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and solubility. These descriptors are calculated using computational tools. The dataset also includes a binary target variable indicating the mutagenicity activity of each compound. The dataset is utilized to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict mutagenicity activity based on the chemical descriptors. This dataset is valuable for researchers working in the field of chemical toxicology and computational chemistry.
