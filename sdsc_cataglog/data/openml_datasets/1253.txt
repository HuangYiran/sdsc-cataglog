name: QSAR-TID-12265
dataset_id: 3229.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12265 dataset includes a collection of 777 compounds with corresponding biological activity data for predicting the inhibition concentration of pesticides on an enzyme. The compounds are represented by their molecular descriptors, such as electrostatic potential, hydrophobicity, and topological indices. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory effect of new pesticides on the enzyme. The dataset is publicly available and can be utilized for computational approaches and machine learning algorithms to improve the understanding and design of potential inhibitors for enzyme-based pesticide development.
