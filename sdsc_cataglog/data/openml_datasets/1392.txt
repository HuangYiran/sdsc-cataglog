name: QSAR-TID-20036
dataset_id: 3370.0
description: The QSAR-TID-20036 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds along with their corresponding measured toxicity values. It consists of 1408 chemical compounds, with each compound having 41 molecular descriptors. The toxicity values represent the logarithm of the concentration that causes 50% inhibition on the reproduction rate of Tetrahymena pyriformis, a ciliated protozoan. The dataset is primarily used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of new chemical compounds. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed for various research purposes, including the development of toxicity prediction models and analysis of structure-activity relationships.
