description: The QSAR-TID-10983 dataset contains information about the toxicity of certain compounds for fish species. The dataset consists of 4732 instances and 102 molecular descriptors. These descriptors capture relevant information about the chemical structure and properties of the compounds. The toxicity of the compounds towards fish is measured using the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) value, which indicates the concentration of a compound that is lethal to 50% of the fish population. The dataset is useful for developing predictive models to determine the toxicity of compounds and can aid in the design of safer chemicals for aquatic environments.
