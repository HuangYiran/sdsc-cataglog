name: QSAR-TID-18025
dataset_id: 3740.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-18025 is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities against a specific target. It contains 816 different compounds and 18 features, out of which 17 are molecular descriptors and the last one is the target value. The data is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) format and can be used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. It was created to develop a predictive model that can estimate the biological activity of new chemical compounds based on their structural characteristics. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed for research or educational purposes.
