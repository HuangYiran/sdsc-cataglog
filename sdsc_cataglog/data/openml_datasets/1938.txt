name: QSAR-TID-20110
dataset_id: 3923.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-20110 consists of 5,064 different molecules, each described by 193 molecular descriptors. These descriptors include information about various physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donor count, and solubility. The dataset also includes the measured biological activity of each molecule, specifically their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against a specific target protein. The molecules in the dataset belong to 4 different chemical classes. The QSAR-TID-20110 dataset is widely used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new molecules against the target protein based on their molecular descriptors.
