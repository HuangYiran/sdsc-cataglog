name: naval_propulsion_plant
dataset_id: 44969.0
description: The naval_propulsion_plant dataset contains data related to a naval propulsion plant's performance metrics. It consists of four features and one target variable that quantifies the behaviour of the plant's propulsion system. The features include temperature, pressure, rotational speed, and fuel flow rate, whereas the target variable indicates power emitted by the plant. The objective of this dataset is to predict the power emitted by the plant, based on the given features. This dataset can be utilized for tasks like regression analysis, machine learning algorithms, and prediction modeling related to naval propulsion plants' performance.
