dataset_id: 4032.0
description: QSAR-TID-101504 is a dataset containing information about chemical compounds and their bioactivity against HIV-1 protease. The dataset consists of 4114 instances, with each instance having 1017 attributes. The compounds are represented by their 2-dimensional molecular structures, and the bioactivity is measured by the Inhibition Constant (Ki) value. The dataset aims to provide data for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the bioactivity of new compounds. The attributes include features like molecular weight, molar refractivity, hydrophobicity, and constitutional descriptors. The dataset is valuable for researchers working in drug design and development, as it can assist in identifying potential compounds for HIV-1 protease inhibition.
