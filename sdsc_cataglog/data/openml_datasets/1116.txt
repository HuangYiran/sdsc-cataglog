name: QSAR-TID-10009
dataset_id: 3092.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10009 contains information about the ability of different chemical compounds to inhibit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It consists of 411 compounds, with each compound represented by 488 molecular descriptors. The data includes quantitative measurements such as log of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (log IC50) and qualitative measurements such as the classification of compounds as active or inactive against HIV. This dataset is primarily used for developing predictive models to identify potential HIV inhibitors. The information provided in this dataset can help researchers in drug discovery and development efforts to combat HIV.
