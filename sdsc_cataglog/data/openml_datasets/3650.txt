description: The dataset "Primary-breast-cancer-vs-Normal-breast-tissue" is used for differentiating primary breast cancer samples from normal breast tissue samples. It contains a total of 699 instances with 9 attributes and a class label indicating whether the sample belongs to primary breast cancer or normal breast tissue. The attributes include characteristics like clump thickness, uniformity of cell size and shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli, mitoses, and class. The dataset is commonly used for breast cancer classification and machine learning research to develop accurate models for early detection and diagnosis of primary breast cancer.
