description: The behavior-cervical dataset is aimed at diagnosing cervical cancer. It consists of 858 instances with 19 attributes, including patients' age and habits such as number of sexual partners, contraceptive use, and whether they have had a sexually transmitted disease. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables. It is specifically designed to assess the relationship between behavior and the likelihood of having cervical pre-cancer or cancer. The target class is binary, representing the presence or absence of the disease. This dataset provides a valuable resource for identifying potential risk factors associated with cervical cancer and can aid in the development of predictive models for early detection and prevention.
