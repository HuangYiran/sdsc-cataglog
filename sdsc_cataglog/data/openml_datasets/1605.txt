name: QSAR-TID-17115
dataset_id: 3590.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17115 consists of 4,401 chemical compounds, each represented by 1024 molecular descriptors. These descriptors are numerical values that capture various properties of the compounds. The compounds have been tested for their ability to inhibit tubulin polymerization, which is relevant in cancer treatment. The dataset includes the inhibitory activity values for each compound, ranging from 0 to 19.833 (IC50 in nM). The objective of the dataset is to develop a model that can predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. This dataset can be useful for researchers in drug discovery and computational chemistry.
