description: The dataset "Contaminant-detection-in-packaged-cocoa-hazelnut-spread-jars-using-Microwaves-Sensing-and-Machine-Learning-10.0GHz" by Urbinati focuses on the detection of contaminants in packaged cocoa-hazelnut spread jars using microwave sensing and machine learning. The dataset includes measurements obtained from 44 different packaged jars, each consisting of different levels of contaminants. Various features, such as amplitude and frequency values, were collected at a frequency of 10.0GHz. These measurements were then used to train and test machine learning models for contaminant detection. The dataset aims to aid in the development and evaluation of algorithms for detecting contaminants in food packaging using microwave sensing and machine learning techniques.
