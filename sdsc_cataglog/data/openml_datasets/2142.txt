name: QSAR-TID-10803
dataset_id: 4128.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10803 contains information about chemical compounds and their biological activities. It includes chemical descriptors for 8,226 compounds, along with their corresponding measured binding values against a specific target protein. The dataset also incorporates additional information such as molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and topological indices. The goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model for the biological activity of compounds based on their chemical properties. Additionally, QSAR-TID-10803 has been used in studies to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms for predicting the binding affinity of compounds to the target protein.
