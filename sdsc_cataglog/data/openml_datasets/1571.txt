name: QSAR-TID-12807
dataset_id: 3555.0
description: QSAR-TID-12807 is a large dataset containing 912 compounds and their associated activities against the target enzyme. The dataset consists of a wide range of features including 2D and 3D descriptors, molecular fingerprints, and physicochemical properties. The compounds are divided into three classes based on their activity levels. The dataset was created to support the development of predictive models for the classification of compounds based on their activity against the target enzyme. It has been successfully used to build machine learning models and can be a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and computational chemistry.
