name: QSAR-TID-11780
dataset_id: 4118.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11780 contains information about the cytotoxicity of various compounds. It includes 74 compounds and 228 molecular descriptors. The target variable is the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), indicating the concentration required to inhibit a biological process by 50%. The molecular descriptors provide characteristics of the compounds like topological, electronic, thermodynamic, and quantum-chemical features. The dataset aims to investigate the relationship between the molecular descriptors and the cytotoxicity, enabling the prediction of IC50 values. This dataset can be utilized in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for identifying potentially cytotoxic compounds in drug discovery and toxicology.
