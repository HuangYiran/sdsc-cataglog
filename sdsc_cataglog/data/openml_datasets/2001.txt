name: QSAR-TID-11871
dataset_id: 3987.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11871 contains information on 10,000 organic molecules and their corresponding properties. The properties include molecular descriptors, like shape, charge, and hydrophobicity, which are used to predict the aquatic toxicity of these molecules. The dataset also includes the measured aquatic toxicity values, which were obtained through experimental testing on fish. The objective is to use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate the toxicity of organic molecules without the need for costly and time-consuming experimental tests. QSAR-TID-11871 provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working on chemical toxicity prediction and risk assessment in aquatic environments.
