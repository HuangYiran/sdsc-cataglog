name: QSAR-TID-112
dataset_id: 3569.0
description: The QSAR-TID-112 dataset consists of 899 compounds with 209 chemical descriptors. The compounds are categorized into two classes: active and inactive. The dataset was created to evaluate classification models for predicting the activity of compounds against a specific target. The dataset has been preprocessed with normalization and missing data handling. The objective is to develop accurate models that can distinguish active from inactive compounds based on their chemical descriptors. Various machine learning techniques have been applied to the dataset, including decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests. The dataset can be useful for developing and evaluating QSAR models in drug discovery research.
