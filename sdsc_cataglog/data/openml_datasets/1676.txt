name: QSAR-TID-10403
dataset_id: 3659.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10403 dataset consists of 3083 chemical compounds, each characterized by 1024 binary features. The compounds are divided into 3 mutually exclusive activity classes, namely, inactive, active, and inconclusive. The dataset aims to help develop models for predicting the activity of compounds based on their features. The dataset can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. The original study that created the dataset utilized it to develop a classification model using machine learning techniques. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded for further analysis and model development.
