name: QSAR-TID-11453
dataset_id: 3077.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11453 is a collection of molecular descriptors and binary outcomes related to the biodegradation potential of certain compounds. It contains 1055 instances and 41 variables. The instances represent different chemical compounds, whereas the variables include features such as atom count, bond count, topological indices, etc. The binary outcome indicates whether a compound is likely to be biodegradable or not. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of predictive models for estimating the biodegradation potential of diverse chemical compounds. However, further exploration and analysis of the dataset are required to understand the relationships between the molecular descriptors and biodegradation outcomes accurately.
