name: QSAR-TID-12415
dataset_id: 3048.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12415 dataset contains information regarding the biological activity of compounds against the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 receptor. It includes 22 molecular descriptors and the measured activities of 44 compounds. These descriptors were calculated using Dragon v5.4. The dataset aims to provide data for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the biological activity of new compounds against the target receptor. The dataset could be useful for researchers and scientists working in drug development and medicinal chemistry, who can use the information to design and evaluate potential compounds for inhibiting the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 receptor.
