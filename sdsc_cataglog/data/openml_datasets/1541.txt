name: QSAR-TID-12071
dataset_id: 3525.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12071 is a collection of chemical compounds and their biological activities. It contains information about 1,071 compounds and is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. The dataset includes 4,290 molecular descriptors that describe the properties and structural features of the compounds. It also provides the corresponding biological activities of the compounds, such as their inhibitory or stimulatory effects on specific biological targets. This dataset is useful for developing predictive models that can help in drug discovery and design processes by relating molecular attributes to biological activities.
