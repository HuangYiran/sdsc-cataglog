name: iris
dataset_id: 41568.0
description: The iris dataset is said to be the "hello world" of machine learning. It is a widely used dataset for testing and benchmarking algorithms. The dataset contains information about 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. There are four features included in the dataset, namely sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features are used to classify the flowers into their respective species. The dataset is commonly utilized for tasks such as classification and clustering algorithms, making it a crucial tool for training and evaluating machine learning models.
