name: QSAR-TID-104390
dataset_id: 3586.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-104390 contains information related to the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) of compounds. It consists of 41 compounds with various physicochemical properties and biological activities. The dataset includes features such as molecular descriptors and structural information about the compounds. The goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model to determine the biological activity of unknown compounds based on their structural characteristics. The dataset has been widely used for the development and evaluation of QSAR models, and it serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the field of drug discovery and computational chemistry.
