name: QSAR-TID-100063
dataset_id: 3140.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100063 consists of 1055 organic compounds and their respective qualitative Toxicity Index (TI) values. The compounds were selected based on their structural and electronic properties. The TI values indicate the toxic level of each compound, with higher values suggesting higher toxicity. The dataset includes 41 numerical molecular descriptors calculated from a compound's structure, such as shape, energy or charge distributions. The compounds are partitioned into two classes, namely nonmutagenic and mutagenic, based on the Ames test results. This dataset is commonly used in the field of QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) modeling to predict the toxicity of organic compounds based on their molecular features.
