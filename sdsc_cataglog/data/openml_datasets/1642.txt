name: QSAR-TID-100942
dataset_id: 3627.0
description: QSAR-TID-100942 is a dataset that contains information about chemical compounds and their inhibitory activities against a particular target protein. The dataset consists of 540 compounds with 41 molecular descriptors, including topological, geometrical, and quantum chemical parameters. Each compound is labeled with its inhibitory activity value. The target protein is associated with cardiovascular diseases. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds against the target protein. This dataset could potentially contribute to the discovery of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
