description: The nursery dataset is a collection of 12 attributes that describe the characteristics of a nursery school. It contains information such as the number of children attending the school, the financial cost of the school, the quality of the school, and the social factors surrounding it. The dataset is categorized into three classes, which are "not recommended," "recommended," and "very recommended," based on the suitability of the school. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the majority of instances falling into the "not recommended" class. The nursery dataset is often used for classification tasks to predict the suitability of a nursery school based on its attributes.
