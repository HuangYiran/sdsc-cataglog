name: QSAR-TID-12898
dataset_id: 3833.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12898 is used for predicting the toxicity of chemicals towards zebrafish embryos. It consists of 3,921 compounds with 16 molecular descriptors that provide information on their chemical properties. The toxicity of these compounds is measured using the toxic concentration at which 50% of the embryos die (LC50 value). The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables, and the toxicity of each compound is classified as highly toxic, weakly toxic, or non-toxic. QSAR models can be developed using this dataset to predict the toxicity of new compounds, which can be valuable for drug discovery and risk assessment in aquatic environments.
