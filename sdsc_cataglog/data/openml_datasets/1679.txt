name: QSAR-TID-101179
dataset_id: 3662.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101179 comprises information on the inhibition concentration (IC50) values of a diverse set of chemical compounds against the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) enzyme. The PTP1B enzyme is an attractive target for developing drugs aimed at treating obesity, diabetes, and cancer. The dataset contains 672 records with 41 molecular descriptors, including topological, constitutional, and electronic descriptors. The purpose of this dataset is to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of novel compounds against PTP1B. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for machine learning and computational chemistry applications.
