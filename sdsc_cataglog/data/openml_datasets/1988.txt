name: QSAR-TID-100129
dataset_id: 3974.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100129 is part of the QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) project and contains information about the biological activity of compounds against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It consists of 1,433 unique compounds, each with 209 features, including hydrophobic, electronic, and steric properties. The compounds are classified into two classes: active or inactive against HIV. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between the molecular structure and biological activity of these compounds. It serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and understanding the factors influencing the effectiveness of compounds against HIV.
