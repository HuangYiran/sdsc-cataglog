name: QSAR-TID-10057
dataset_id: 3910.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10057 consists of 118 chemical compounds, each represented by 41 molecular descriptors. These descriptors include properties such as charge, dipole and polarizability. The compounds are characterized by their mutagenic activity, which measures their potential to cause changes in DNA. The dataset provides insightful information for studying relationships between molecular characteristics and mutagenicity. It was curated to investigate the effectiveness of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models in predicting chemical mutagenicity. It offers a valuable resource for researchers interested in developing computational models for predicting the mutagenic activity of chemical compounds based on their structural features.
