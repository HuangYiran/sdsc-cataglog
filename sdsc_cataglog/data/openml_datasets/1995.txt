name: QSAR-TID-10183
dataset_id: 3981.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10183 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds and their activity against a certain biological target. It contains 7,831 compounds and 208 molecular descriptors that were calculated for each compound. These descriptors include information about the compounds' size, shape, electronic properties, and more. The dataset also includes the activity values for each compound, which are expressed as IC50 values. The purpose of this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the activity of new compounds against the biological target based on their molecular descriptors.
