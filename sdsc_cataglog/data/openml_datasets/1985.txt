name: QSAR-TID-10796
dataset_id: 3971.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10796 contains information about chemical compounds and their biological activities. It includes 4,783 compounds with 1024 binary fingerprints, and their respective antitumor activities against a specific protein target. Each compound is represented by a 2D structural formula and assigned a unique identifier. The dataset also provides the experimentally measured values for the compounds' inhibition activity. This dataset is useful for developing models for predicting the biological activities of chemical compounds based on their structure, as well as for understanding the underlying factors influencing these activities.
