name: QSAR-TID-11408
dataset_id: 3730.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11408 contains information on the mutagenic potential of various chemicals. It includes a total of 4,854 chemical compounds. Each compound is described by 41 molecular descriptors, such as hydrophobicity, electronic properties, and shape information. The dataset also provides the mutagenic activity of each compound, categorized as either positive (mutagen) or negative (non-mutagen). The aim of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify the mutagenic potential of unknown compounds based on their molecular properties. The dataset is commonly used in machine learning applications to build predictive models for mutagenicity assessment.
