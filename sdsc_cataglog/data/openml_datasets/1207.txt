name: QSAR-TID-30008
dataset_id: 3183.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30008 contains information about 1057 compounds and their corresponding toxicity activity on rats. The data includes 224 molecular descriptors and the experimental LD50 test value, which is the median lethal dose required to kill half the rats. The compounds have varying structures and properties, including aromatic and heterocyclic structures. The main objective of this dataset is to explore the relationship between the molecular descriptors and the toxicity activity of the compounds. The dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and other related studies in the field of toxicology and drug discovery. Overall, QSAR-TID-30008 provides valuable data for investigating toxicity and designing safer compounds.
