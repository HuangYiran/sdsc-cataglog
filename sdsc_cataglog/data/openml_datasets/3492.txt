name: Metal-Concentrations
dataset_id: 43568.0
description: The dataset consists of metal concentrations in various water samples collected from different locations. The concentrations of different metals such as lead, zinc, copper, and iron were measured in parts per million (ppm) using a highly sensitive instrument. The samples were obtained from sources like rivers, lakes, and underground water reservoirs at different depths. The dataset provides information on the variability of metal concentrations across different locations and depths. The data can be used to analyze trends, assess water quality, and monitor potential pollution sources. It provides valuable insights into the current state of metal contamination in water bodies and can aid in decision-making for environmental protection and conservation efforts.
