name: QSAR-TID-8
dataset_id: 3604.0
description: The QSAR-TID-8 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds with activity against trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. The dataset consists of 2,495 compounds and 17 molecular descriptors that represent important features of the compounds. The aim of this dataset is to predict the activity of the compounds against trichomoniasis based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset was created to aid in the development of new and effective drugs to treat trichomoniasis. Its availability enables researchers to apply various machine learning techniques and algorithms to generate predictive models for drug discovery in the field of trichomoniasis treatment.
