name: MiniBooNE
dataset_id: 43974.0
description: The MiniBooNE dataset refers to a collection of data obtained from a neutrino oscillation experiment conducted by the MiniBooNE Collaboration between 2002 and 2008. The dataset contains information on the interactions between neutrinos and different types of particles, enabling study on neutrino oscillation behavior. It consists of over six million neutrino and antineutrino events, with recorded features such as momenta, energies, angles, and particle identification. One of its significant aims was to investigate the existence of sterile neutrinos, a hypothetical particle type that goes beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The dataset has been made publicly available for broader scientific utilization and analysis.
