name: QSAR-TID-10627
dataset_id: 3926.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10627 contains information on the toxicity of 206 chemical compounds against the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium. It includes 41 molecular descriptors that provide information about the structure and properties of the compounds. The toxicity values are given as binary outputs, where 1 represents a compound that is toxic and 0 represents a non-toxic compound. The dataset aims to help in the prediction and understanding of the toxicity of chemical compounds. It can be used for various tasks, such as building predictive models and evaluating the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for toxicity prediction.
