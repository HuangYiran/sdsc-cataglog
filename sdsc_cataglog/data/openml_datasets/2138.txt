name: QSAR-TID-56
dataset_id: 4124.0
description: The QSAR-TID-56 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds with attributes relating to their biological activity and toxicity. It consists of 74 compounds, each described by 256 features. The dataset includes information about the compounds' molecular and constitutional properties, as well as their topological, electronic, and flexible properties. The biological activity of the compounds is measured using an IC50 value, which represents their inhibitory concentration. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the mutagenicity of the compounds. QSAR-TID-56 serves as a valuable resource for studying structure-activity relationships and developing predictive models for toxicity and mutagenicity in chemical compounds.
