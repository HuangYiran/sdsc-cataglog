name: QSAR-TID-10426
dataset_id: 4010.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10426 dataset consists of biological activities for a set of compounds. It includes the inhibitory concentration values (IC50) of compounds against a specific target. The dataset was derived from several sources, ensuring a wide diversity of compounds. The compounds were chosen based on their structural diversity and biological relevance. The dataset also includes molecular descriptors, such as electronic, geometric, and topological attributes. These descriptors are used to predict the activity value of new compounds. The dataset aims to aid in the development of models for predicting the activity of compounds and to support further research in drug discovery and design.
