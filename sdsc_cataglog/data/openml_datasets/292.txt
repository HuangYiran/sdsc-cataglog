description: The dataset analcatdata_galapagos provides information about the vegetation cover on different volcanic sites of the Galapagos Islands. It consists of 18 observations and 4 variables: the site ID, the elevation of the site, the species richness (number of plant species) at the site, and the vegetation cover (percentage of each plant species). The dataset aims to study the relationship between elevation and species richness, as well as the vegetation cover pattern across different sites. It also serves as a reference for understanding the diversity and distribution of plant species in the Galapagos Islands, which are known for their unique flora and fauna.
