name: QSAR-TID-100848
dataset_id: 3167.0
description: QSAR-TID-100848 is a dataset used for quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis in drug discovery. It contains information about 444 compounds and their corresponding biological activities. The dataset provides molecular descriptors, including physicochemical properties, topological indices, and electronic properties, which can be used to predict the compounds' activity. The compounds are classified into two categories: active and inactive. The dataset also includes experimental activity values, allowing for model validation. QSAR-TID-100848 is a valuable resource for developing predictive models in drug design and exploring the relationship between molecular structures and biological activities.
