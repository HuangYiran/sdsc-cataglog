name: QSAR-TID-103453
dataset_id: 4014.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103453 contains chemical compounds with their corresponding quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) values. The compounds are classified based on their toxicological properties, indicating whether they are toxic or non-toxic. The dataset also includes multiple features such as molecular descriptors and environmental factors that can help predict the toxicity. It consists of 540 compounds, with 82% being non-toxic and 18% being toxic. The dataset is useful for developing QSAR models and finding relationships between molecular characteristics and toxicity, aiding in the design and assessment of new chemical compounds with reduced toxicity.
