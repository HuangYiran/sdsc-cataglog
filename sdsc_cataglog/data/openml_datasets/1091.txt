name: QSAR-TID-101386
dataset_id: 3067.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101386 dataset contains information about 1055 chemical compounds and their inhibitory activity against a specific target protein related to tuberculosis. The dataset includes various attributes such as the molecular structure, physicochemical properties, and other molecular descriptors of the compounds. The inhibitory activity is measured using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of novel compounds against the target protein. It can be used by researchers in drug discovery and computational chemistry to improve the efficiency of identifying potential anti-tuberculosis drugs.
