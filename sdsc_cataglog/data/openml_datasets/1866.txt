name: QSAR-TID-10809
dataset_id: 3851.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10809 dataset contains molecular descriptors and biological activities of various molecules. It is widely used in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies to predict the biological activities of new compounds. The dataset consists of 5,672 molecules, each represented by 15 molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, polarizability, and solvent accessible surface area. The biological activity of each molecule is classified into one of three categories, namely toxic, intermediate, or non-toxic. QSAR models can be developed using this dataset to identify the relationship between the molecular descriptors and biological activities, aiding in the discovery of potential drugs or chemicals with desired properties.
