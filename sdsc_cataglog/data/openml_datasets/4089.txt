name: anneal
dataset_id: 44266.0
description: The dataset "anneal" is used for predicting the mechanical properties of steel, based on its chemical composition and processing parameters. It consists of 29 attributes, including the chemical composition, heating temperature, and cooling rate, along with the mechanical properties like yield strength and tensile strength. The data represents 798 instances of steel samples. The aim is to analyze and classify the steel into different categories based on its mechanical properties. The dataset was initially collected for a study related to improving the steel-making process. The information provided in the dataset is essential for understanding the relationship between the steel's composition, processing, and resulting mechanical properties.
