name: Meta_Album_BRD_Micro
dataset_id: 44241.0
description: The dataset Meta_Album_BRD_Micro contains information about small molecule compounds and their effects on gene expression in human cells. It includes data from high-throughput screenings of the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Small Molecule/Compound Library. The dataset provides comprehensive information including compound IDs, concentrations, experimental conditions, and gene expression profiles. It also includes metadata such as compound structures, activities, and molecular targets. The dataset is valuable for understanding the mechanisms of small molecule compounds and their potential for therapeutic purposes. It can aid in drug discovery and development and assist in understanding drug-induced changes in gene expression.
