name: QSAR-TID-12238
dataset_id: 3208.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12238 is related to Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) of various compounds. The dataset contains information on 1627 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. The compounds are described by 1024 molecular descriptors, including information about their structural and chemical properties. The target variable of interest is the Log IC50 value, which indicates the inhibitory concentration of a particular compound. The dataset is used to develop models that can predict the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset can be useful in drug discovery and development processes to identify potential bioactive compounds.
