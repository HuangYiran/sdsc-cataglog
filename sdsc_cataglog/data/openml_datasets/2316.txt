name: mnist_rotation
dataset_id: 41065.0
description: The dataset mnist_rotation consists of a collection of handwritten digits from zero to nine, with each digit being represented by a 28x28 pixel image. The unique aspect of this dataset is that each image is rotated at random angles between 0 and 360 degrees. This rotation helps in training and testing machine learning algorithms that need to be robust and accurate in recognizing digits regardless of their orientation. The dataset comprises 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithms. Moreso, the dataset includes labels indicating the actual digit represented in each image.
