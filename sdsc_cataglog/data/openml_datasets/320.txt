name: kdd_coil_2
dataset_id: 568.0
description: The dataset kdd_coil_2 is a collection of 982 examples representing steel-coil surfaces. Each example consists of 1,618 attributes, including geometric measurements and wavelet-based texture features. The dataset is divided into two classes: positive (defective) and negative (non-defective) coils, with 348 positive and 634 negative examples. The attribute values are preprocessed and scaled to fit within a certain range. The goal of using this dataset is to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms for classifying steel-coil surfaces as either defective or non-defective based on the provided attributes.
