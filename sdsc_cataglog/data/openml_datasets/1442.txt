name: QSAR-TID-12593
dataset_id: 3422.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12593 dataset contains information on the quantitative structure-activity relationship of a set of compounds. It includes 251 molecules with 828 molecular descriptors. The datasets aim to predict the toxicity of these compounds based on their molecular characteristics. The data is provided in CSV format, with molecular descriptors as features and the corresponding activity as the target variable. The dataset's variables include molecular weight, solubility, polarizability, hydrophobicity, and many others. The toxicity is measured using an experimental endpoint. This dataset can be useful for researchers working in the field of toxicity prediction and computational chemistry.
