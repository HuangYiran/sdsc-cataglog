name: seeds
dataset_id: 1499.0
description: The dataset seeds comprises measurements of seven geometric parameters of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. The goal of the dataset is to classify the seeds into their corresponding varieties based on these measurements. The dataset consists of 210 samples, with 70 samples for each variety. Each sample is described by seven attributes: area, perimeter, compactness, length of kernel, width of kernel, asymmetry coefficient, and length groove. The dataset is commonly used for pattern recognition and machine learning tasks such as classification algorithms.
