name: QSAR-TID-12485
dataset_id: 3285.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12485 contains information about a set of compounds that have been tested for their ability to inhibit the enzyme thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), which is associated with cancer. The dataset includes 8 molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight and polarizability, as well as the activity of each compound against TK1. The goal of this dataset is to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model that can predict the activity of new compounds against TK1. The dataset is suitable for machine learning and regression analysis to explore the relationship between the molecular descriptors and the TK1 inhibitory activity.
