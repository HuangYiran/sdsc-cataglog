dataset_id: 42030.0
description: The iris dataset is a popular and frequently used dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, where each sample has four features, namely the length and width of the sepal, and the length and width of the petal. The dataset is widely used for classification tasks and pattern recognition algorithms. It is often used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms. The iris dataset is easily accessible and allows for the exploration and experimentation of different algorithms and techniques in a controlled manner.
