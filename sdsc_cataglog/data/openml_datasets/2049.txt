name: QSAR-TID-11499
dataset_id: 4035.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11499 contains information about the inhibitory activity of chemical compounds on the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. The data includes 4,799 chemical compounds, each described by 41 molecular descriptors. The target variable is the inhibitory activity on acetylcholinesterase, which is measured using the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in nM. The IC50 values range from 0.11 nM to 9.99 ÂµM. The dataset aims to enable the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds on acetylcholinesterase.
