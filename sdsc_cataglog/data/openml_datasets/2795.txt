description: The iris-example dataset is a well-known and frequently-used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of measurements of four features of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species of the iris. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset is often used for classification tasks, as it allows for the training and evaluation of various algorithms. It is considered a useful benchmark dataset due to its simplicity and well-defined classes.
