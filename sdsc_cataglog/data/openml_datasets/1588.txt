name: QSAR-TID-20067
dataset_id: 3573.0
description: QSAR-TID-20067 is a dataset comprising 300 molecules and their corresponding biological activity values. It was created to predict the toxicological effect of chemicals through quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). The dataset includes various molecular descriptors, such as topological, geometric, and constitutional features. The biological activity values represent the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each molecule. The dataset was collected from various open-source databases, experimental studies, and expert guidelines. It aims to facilitate the development of reliable QSAR models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds, ultimately aiding in drug discovery and safety assessment in pharmaceutical research.
