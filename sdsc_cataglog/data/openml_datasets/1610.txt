description: QSAR-TID-102576 is a dataset containing information on the biological activity of chemical compounds. The dataset consists of 6,280 compounds, each with 102 numerical molecular descriptors and a binary outcome variable indicating their bioactivity. The compounds vary in their structural features and are described by various physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight, polarity, and ionization potential. The data aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the bioactivity of unknown compounds based on their molecular descriptors. This dataset offers an opportunity for researchers to explore and validate QSAR models for drug design and toxicology studies.
