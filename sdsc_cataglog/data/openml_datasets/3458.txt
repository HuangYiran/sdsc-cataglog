name: Production-cross-sections-of-Inert-Doublet-Model
dataset_id: 43534.0
description: The Production-cross-sections-of-Inert-Doublet-Model dataset provides values of the production cross sections for various processes involving the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) particles. The IDM is a theoretical model that extends the Standard Model of particle physics by introducing a dark matter candidate. The dataset includes cross sections for processes such as annihilation, production through gauge boson fusion, and scattering with other particles. These values are important in the study of dark matter properties and can be used to compare with experimental data to test the viability of the IDM. The dataset is organized and provides cross-section results for different energies and IDM particle masses.
