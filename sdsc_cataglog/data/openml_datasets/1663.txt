name: QSAR-TID-12202
dataset_id: 3646.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12202 dataset contains information related to the toxicity of various chemicals. It includes 465 compounds, with each compound having 698 molecular descriptors. The dataset provides data on the toxicity of these compounds measured as logLD50 values, which represent the lethal dose needed to kill half of a test animal population. The compounds belong to different chemical classes and were tested on different species of animals. The dataset also includes additional information like chemical structures, CAS numbers, and SMILES notations. It can be valuable for developing QSAR models to predict the toxicity of new chemicals and for exploring the relationship between molecular structure and toxicity.
