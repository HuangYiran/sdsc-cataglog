dataset_id: 3254.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101496 contains information on various molecular properties and biological activities of 101496 compounds. These compounds are potential HIV protease inhibitors, which are important in the development of drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. The dataset includes 5 descriptors, representing molecular structures, and a binary class label indicating whether the compound is active (1) or inactive (0) against the target enzyme. The dataset is used for classification tasks, particularly in machine learning approaches to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds. Research in this area aims to discover new and effective drugs for the treatment of HIV.
