name: QSAR-TID-100613
dataset_id: 3751.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100613 is a collection of chemical compounds used for drug discovery. It consists of 1,006 compounds with various structural and physicochemical properties. Each compound is labeled with their binding affinity towards a specific protein target. The data is obtained using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which predict the biological activity of compounds based on their chemical features. This dataset can be utilized for training and testing machine learning algorithms to develop new drugs or analyze the relationship between chemical structures and their biological activity. It provides valuable information for researchers in the field of drug design and molecular biology.
