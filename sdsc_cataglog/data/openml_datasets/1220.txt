name: QSAR-TID-102
dataset_id: 3196.0
description: QSAR-TID-102 is a dataset that contains information about 1055 chemical compounds. It includes various molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, density, and atomic properties. The dataset also includes binary information about the toxicity of these chemical compounds. The toxicity values were obtained through experimental assays and are represented as "active" or "inactive". The dataset is commonly used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, which aim to predict the biological activities of chemical compounds based on their structural features. It has been widely used for developing predictive models and evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms in toxicology and drug discovery research.
