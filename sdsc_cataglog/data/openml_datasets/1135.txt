name: QSAR-TID-102406
dataset_id: 3111.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102406 contains information on the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of chemicals. It consists of 329 compounds with their respective biological activities. The activities are measured by different assay methods and expressed as IC50 values, which represent the concentration required to inhibit 50% of a specific biological function. The compounds are categorized into seven different chemical classes, including carboxylic acids, esters, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, halogenated compounds, and miscellaneous compounds. The dataset also provides the molecular descriptors for each compound, which are numerical values representing various chemical properties. This dataset can be used for developing and validating QSAR models to predict the biological activities of new compounds.
