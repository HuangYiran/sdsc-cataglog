name: QSAR-TID-11680
dataset_id: 3735.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11680 contains information on the biological activity of various compounds against a specific target. It consists of 4,155 instances with 102 numerical predictor variables, representing various chemical descriptors and molecular properties. The dataset was previously utilized for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The values of the predictor variables were standardized. The target variable represents the biological activity of the compounds, which is continuous and ranges from 2.39 to 6.12. QSAR-TID-11680 is a valuable resource for researchers working on drug design and discovery, allowing them to analyze and predict compound activity against the specific target.
