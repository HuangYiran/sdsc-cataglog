name: chscase_geyser1
dataset_id: 895.0
description: The dataset "chscase_geyser1" contains information about the duration and waiting time for eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park. It consists of 299 observations and two variables: duration (the length of time the eruption lasts) and waiting (the length of time between eruptions). The dataset is useful to study the relationship between these two variables and to analyze the patterns and behavior of the geyser. Researchers can use this dataset to explore the average duration and waiting time of eruptions, identify any trends or patterns, and potentially make predictions about future eruptions based on the observed data.
