name: mne-sample-meg-auditory
dataset_id: 43884.0
description: The dataset "mne-sample-meg-auditory" is a collection of neural recordings captured during an auditory experiment. It consists of data from multiple participants, each of whom was subjected to auditory stimuli in the form of tones. The dataset provides information about the participants' brain activity in response to these stimuli, including time series data of the neural oscillations and event-related potentials. Additionally, it contains additional metadata such as the participants' demographics and the experimental design. The dataset is intended for researchers and can be used to explore various aspects of auditory processing and further the understanding of the brain's response to auditory stimuli.
