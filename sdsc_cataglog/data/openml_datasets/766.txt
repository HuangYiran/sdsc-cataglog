name: grub-damage
dataset_id: 1026.0
description: The dataset grub-damage focuses on the impact of grubs, soil-dwelling larvae of beetles, on the health and production of crops. It contains observations from experimental plots where various treatments, such as different insecticides and crop rotations, were applied to manage the grub populations. The dataset includes information on factors like the plot location, abundance of grubs, crop type and yield, insecticide application, and soil characteristics. Analysis of this dataset can help understand the effectiveness of different management strategies in reducing grub damage, improving crop yields, and informing decisions about sustainable pest management practices.
