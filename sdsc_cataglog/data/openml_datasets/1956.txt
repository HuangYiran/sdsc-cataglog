dataset_id: 3941.0
description: QSAR-TID-10578 is a dataset containing 10578 chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. The dataset provides information about the compounds' structural descriptors, such as atom count, molecular weight, and topological indices. It also includes the compounds' properties related to human health and environment, such as mutagenicity and skin sensitization. This dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their chemical structures. The dataset is freely available and can be used for various research purposes, including drug discovery and toxicity prediction.
