dataset_id: 43582.0
description: The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset consists of several medical measurements for 768 Pima Indian females. These measurements include the number of times a woman had been pregnant, their glucose concentration level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, and their age. The objective is to predict whether or not the individual will develop diabetes within five years. The dataset has been widely used for research and analysis on diabetes, usually to develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms. It provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to diabetes in the Pima Indian population.
