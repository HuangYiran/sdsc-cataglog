dataset_id: 3881.0
description: QSAR-TID-10961 is a dataset containing information on 6791 chemical compounds. It provides details about their chemical structures and biological activities, particularly their toxicity towards the rat fetus. The dataset includes 259 descriptors, including topological, geometric, and constitutional properties, as well as electronic and thermodynamic parameters. Additionally, there are indications of the presence or absence of certain structural fragments within the compounds. The data was collected using quantum-chemical calculations and experimental measurements. It aims to facilitate studies related to chemical toxicity prediction and the development of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models for assessing potential risks to the rat fetus.
