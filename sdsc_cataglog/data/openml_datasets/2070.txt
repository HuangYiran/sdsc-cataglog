name: QSAR-TID-277
dataset_id: 4056.0
description: The QSAR-TID-277 dataset is a collection of 277 compounds that have been tested for their ability to bind to specific receptors in the body. The dataset contains various molecular attributes such as molecular weight, solubility, and lipophilicity, along with the activity level of each compound. The compounds are divided into two classes: "active" and "inactive" based on their binding activity. The dataset is useful for developing predictive models to identify compounds that have the potential to bind to the receptors and can be utilized in drug discovery and development.
