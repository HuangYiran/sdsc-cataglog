name: QSAR-TID-101090
dataset_id: 3925.0
description: QSAR-TID-101090 is a dataset containing information about 868 dipeptides. Each dipeptide is represented by 164 molecular descriptors, which include physical and chemical properties. These properties describe the structure and behavior of the dipeptides. The dataset also includes a target variable, which represents the biological response of the dipeptides. The objective of this dataset is to build predictive models that can accurately predict the biological response based on the molecular descriptors. The dataset is useful for conducting studies and research related to drug design and bioactivity prediction.
