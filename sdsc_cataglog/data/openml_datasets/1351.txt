name: QSAR-TID-12474
dataset_id: 3328.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12474 consists of 4,999 chemical compounds with associated biological activities. These compounds were represented using 41 molecular descriptors, including electronic, topological, and geometrical properties. The biological activities of the compounds were measured using a toxicity endpoint, specifically the inhibitory activity against thrombin, a blood-clotting enzyme. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of new chemical compounds against thrombin. It provides researchers with a valuable resource for studying the relationship between molecular descriptors and biological activity, aiding in the design of new thrombin inhibitors.
