name: waveform-5000
dataset_id: 979.0
description: The waveform-5000 dataset is a collection of audio waveforms and their corresponding class labels. It contains 5,000 different waveforms, each representing a different sound clip. The dataset includes various classes of sounds, such as music, speech, and noises. The waveforms are sampled at a rate of 16 kHz and have a duration of 3 seconds. The class labels provide information about the type of sound in each waveform. This dataset can be used for tasks like audio classification and sound recognition, enabling the development of machine learning models in this field.
