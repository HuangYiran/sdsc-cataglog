name: BNG(pharynx)
dataset_id: 1196.0
description: The BNG (pharynx) dataset is a comprehensive resource that focuses on the pharynx region of the body. It covers various aspects, including anatomical, developmental, and gene expression data, providing a deeper understanding of this important area. The dataset contains detailed information about pharyngeal structures and their variations, as well as molecular profiles that contribute to pharyngeal development. Researchers can explore gene expression patterns during different stages of development, potential genetic contributors to pharynx-related disorders, and the interplay between genes and development in this region. The BNG (pharynx) dataset serves as a valuable tool for studying and unraveling the complexities of the pharynx.
