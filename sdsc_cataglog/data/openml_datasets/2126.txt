name: QSAR-TID-100906
dataset_id: 4112.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100906 is a compilation of 1055 chemical compounds and their biological activities, represented by numerical values. The compounds belong to a diverse range of chemical classes, making this dataset suitable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The dataset provides various molecular descriptors, such as 2D and 3D properties, constitutional, topological, and geometrical characteristics. Additionally, it includes experimental results for the inhibitory activity of compounds against a specific target. This dataset is valuable for researchers in drug discovery and predictive toxicology as it enables the development of models to predict the biological activity of new compounds.
