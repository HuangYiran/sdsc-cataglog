name: QSAR-TID-10044
dataset_id: 3567.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10044 is focused on the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicological properties of chemical compounds. It contains 913 chemical compounds with various descriptors and their corresponding toxicity values. The dataset was curated using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. The objective behind this dataset is to enable accurate predictions of the toxicological properties of chemical compounds, which in turn can aid in the identification and design of safer chemicals for various industrial and pharmaceutical applications. The dataset provides valuable information for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery, chemical safety, and environmental risk assessment.
