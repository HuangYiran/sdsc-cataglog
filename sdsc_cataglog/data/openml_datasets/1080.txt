name: QSAR-TID-100951
dataset_id: 3056.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100951 contains information about the biological activity of a set of chemical compounds. The compounds were screened for their potential use as inhibitors of a specific enzyme involved in the metabolism of drugs. The dataset provides descriptions of the compounds and their physico-chemical properties, along with their corresponding biological activities. The biological activity is measured using an inhibition constant (Ki) which indicates the potency of the compound as an inhibitor. This dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new chemical compounds and aid in the discovery of potential drug candidates.
