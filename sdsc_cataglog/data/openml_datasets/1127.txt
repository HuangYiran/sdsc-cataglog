name: QSAR-TID-250
dataset_id: 3103.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-250 contains 250 chemical compounds with their corresponding quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) values. The QSAR values represent the biological activity of these compounds against a specific target. The dataset includes various descriptors for each compound, such as molecular weight, molecular volume, and number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. These descriptors provide insights into the chemical properties of the compounds, which can be used to predict their biological activity. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scientists studying QSAR and pharmaceutical drug discovery.
