name: pathfinder_4
dataset_id: 45245.0
description: The dataset pathfinder_4 consists of natural language instructions and navigation maps aimed at evaluating human-like robotic navigation. It includes 4,095 indoor environments, with each containing an instruction and a corresponding map. The instructions are provided in English and are collected from human annotators, and multiple instructions are given for each environment. The maps are represented as a top-down grid of squares, indicating navigable and non-navigable regions, with color coding for different elements. The dataset also includes additional information such as spatial semantics, object presence, and room types. This dataset is useful for training and evaluating robotic navigation models with natural language instructions.
