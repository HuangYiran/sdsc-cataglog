description: Dataset link_6 contains information about housing prices in a particular city. The dataset consists of 10,000 records with multiple features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, and price. Each record represents a different house listing. The dataset also includes additional information like the year the house was built, the distance to the nearest school, and the type of property. The goal of this dataset is to analyze the relationship between the features and the housing prices, and to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its characteristics. The dataset is well-structured and provides ample data to conduct a comprehensive analysis.
