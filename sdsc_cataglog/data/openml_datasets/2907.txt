name: test_hate_vects
dataset_id: 42554.0
description: The dataset test_hate_vects contains vectorized text samples that represent hate speech. The samples have been transformed into numerical vectors using techniques like word embeddings or bag-of-words. The vectors capture the semantic meaning and context of the hate speech texts. The dataset is likely preprocessed and cleaned to remove any irrelevant information or noise. The purpose of this dataset is to train and evaluate machine learning models to detect and classify hate speech accurately. It can be used as an input to algorithms like natural language processing or deep learning models to develop applications that can identify and mitigate hate speech online.
