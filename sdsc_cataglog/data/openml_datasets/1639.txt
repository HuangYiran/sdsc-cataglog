name: QSAR-TID-101220
dataset_id: 3624.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101220 is a collection of 4,957 compounds and their corresponding experimental and predicted activity against the target protein. The compounds are represented by molecular descriptors, such as Lipinski's rule of five and other calculated parameters. The target protein belongs to a protein family involved in various biological processes, including disease pathways. The dataset provides information on compound potency and activity, allowing the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers in drug discovery and development, assisting in the design of potential drug molecules with desired activity against the target protein.
