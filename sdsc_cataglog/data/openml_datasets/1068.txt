name: QSAR-TID-12514
dataset_id: 3044.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12514 is comprised of 252 chemical compounds with 1484 molecular descriptors. The compounds belong to one of two classes: active or inactive. 122 compounds are classified as active, while the remaining 130 are inactive. The purpose of the dataset is to analyze the relationship between molecular descriptors and the activity of the compounds. The available descriptors cover various aspects of the compounds' structure and physical properties. This dataset can be used for predictive modeling to classify new compounds as active or inactive based on their molecular descriptors.
