name: iris
dataset_id: 42045.0
description: The iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is often used for classification tasks, as it is well-balanced and allows for easy evaluation of algorithms. It is widely used for teaching, benchmarking, and experimentation, and has become a reference dataset for pattern recognition techniques. The iris dataset is included in many machine learning libraries and is easily accessible for analysis and experimentation.
