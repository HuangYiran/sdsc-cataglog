name: QSAR-TID-102826
dataset_id: 3990.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102826 contains information about potential drugs and their biological activity. There are 3772 compounds in total, with 1027 active and 2745 inactive compounds. The compounds' biological activity was evaluated using an assay that measures their effects on a specific enzyme, with the goal of finding new drug candidates. The dataset also includes structural properties and molecular descriptors of the compounds, such as molecular weight, solubility, and number of bonds. This dataset is useful for developing models and algorithms to predict the biological activity of new compounds and aid in drug discovery efforts.
