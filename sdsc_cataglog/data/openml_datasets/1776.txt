name: QSAR-TID-69
dataset_id: 3759.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-69 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activity values. It consists of 69 instances with nine numerical features and one binary target variable representing the activity. The dataset was created for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of chemical compounds based on their structural properties. It is widely used in cheminformatics research and has been previously employed for machine learning-based prediction of bioactivity. The dataset can be utilized to build and evaluate QSAR models, aiding in drug discovery and toxicity analysis.
