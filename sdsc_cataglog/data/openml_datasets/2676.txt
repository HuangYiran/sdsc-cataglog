name: iris
dataset_id: 41997.0
description: The iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset consists of 150 instances, with 50 instances per species. Its main purpose is to classify new iris flowers based on their measurements using various algorithms. It is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of classification models. Due to its simplicity and availability, the iris dataset has become a standard dataset for practicing and understanding classification techniques.
