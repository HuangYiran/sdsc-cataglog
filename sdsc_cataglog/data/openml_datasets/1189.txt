name: QSAR-TID-129
dataset_id: 3165.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-129 is composed of 129 molecular compounds, with each compound represented by 41 molecular descriptors. The compounds belong to two classes: active and inactive. These classes indicate the biological activity of the compounds against a specific target. The dataset was designed with the aim of developing a model for predicting the biological activity of similar compounds. The dataset has been used in various studies to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms and to assess their ability to accurately predict the activity of the compounds.
