name: kits-subset
dataset_id: 42762.0
description: The dataset kits-subset is introduced, which is a collection of 1,368 annotated subjects' brain MRI scans. It includes representative images obtained from a wide range of clinical scenarios, such as glioblastoma, brain metastases, meningioma, lymphoma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The scans cover multiple modalities, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and diffusion-weighted imaging. The images were acquired from different institutions using various scanners, resulting in diverse resolutions and voxel sizes. The dataset aims to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for brain tumor segmentation, classification, and other related tasks, thereby promoting advancements in the field of neuroimaging.
