name: QSAR-TID-12968
dataset_id: 3657.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12968 dataset contains information on 1109 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. The compounds are categorized into three classes based on their effectiveness against a specific target. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical attributes, such as molecular descriptors and molecular fingerprints. Additionally, the dataset provides information on the compounds' solubility and bioconcentration factor. The purpose of this dataset is to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the biological activity of new compounds. The dataset can be used for training and validating machine learning algorithms for drug discovery and development.
