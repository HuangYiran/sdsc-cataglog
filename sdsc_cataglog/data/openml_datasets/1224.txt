name: QSAR-TID-100843
dataset_id: 3200.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100843 contains information about the biological activity of molecules against specific targets. It has 960 instances and 14 input features, including topological descriptors and atomic properties. The target variable represents the logarithm of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which indicate the compound's potency against a specific target. The dataset exhibits class imbalance, with a larger number of active compounds compared to inactive ones. QSAR-TID-100843 is suitable for building predictive models and conducting research in the field of drug discovery and development. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for various purposes, such as developing computational models or evaluating novel compounds.
