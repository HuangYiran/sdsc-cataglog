name: QSAR-TID-103446
dataset_id: 3577.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103446 contains information about 105 chemical compounds and their respective qualities. The dataset aims to analyze the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for these compounds. It provides attributes such as molecular descriptors, shape indices, experimental toxicity values, and predicted toxicity values. The compounds belong to diverse chemical families and have been tested against multiple organisms. The dataset also includes data about molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and the lipophilicity coefficient. This dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and prediction of compound toxicity, which is crucial for drug development and safety assessment in the pharmaceutical industry.
