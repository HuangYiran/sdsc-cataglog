name: QSAR-TID-10264
dataset_id: 4052.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10264 is a collection of chemical compounds with associated biological activities. It contains information about 485 compounds and their corresponding inhibition values against a specific enzyme. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors such as lipophilicity, size, shape, and electronic properties of the compounds. Additionally, it contains information about the presence of specific molecular structures within the compounds. This dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibition values of new compounds against the enzyme. The dataset is publicly available and can aid in drug design and discovery research.
