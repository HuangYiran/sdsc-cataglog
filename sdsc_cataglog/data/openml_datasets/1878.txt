name: QSAR-TID-238
dataset_id: 3863.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-238 contains information about molecules and their biological activity. It includes 238 molecules and 7 features, as well as the biological activity measured on a scale from 0 to 1. The molecules in the dataset have a wide range of biological activities, spanning from inactive to active. The features include molecular properties such as molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The dataset is used for studying the relationships between these features and the biological activity of the molecules. By analyzing this dataset, researchers can gain insights into the characteristics that contribute to the biological activity of molecules and potentially use this information for drug discovery purposes.
