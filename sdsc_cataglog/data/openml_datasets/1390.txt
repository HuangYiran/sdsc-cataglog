name: QSAR-TID-12132
dataset_id: 3367.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12132 contains information about the biological activity of chemical compounds. It consists of 3888 instances, each with 1024 attributes. The attributes are a representation of the molecular structure of the compounds. The dataset is divided into two classes: active and inactive compounds. The aim is to predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular structure. The dataset is publicly available and has been used in various studies, mainly in the field of cheminformatics. The QSAR-TID-12132 dataset offers an opportunity to explore and develop predictive models for chemical compound activity prediction.
