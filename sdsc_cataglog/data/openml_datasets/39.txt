name: splice
dataset_id: 46.0
description: The dataset "splice" is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning for gene recognition and prediction. It consists of DNA sequences derived from various genes, classified into three categories: exon, intron, and non-coding region. The dataset is typically used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to correctly classify each sequence as either a splice site or a non-splice site. The dataset contains a total of 3190 sequences, with the majority being non-splice sites. Data exploration and analysis on this dataset help researchers develop effective machine learning models and algorithms for gene identification and prediction.
