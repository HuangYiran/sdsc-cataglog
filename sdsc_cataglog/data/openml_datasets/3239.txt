name: PhosphoproteinChallenge_DREAM3
dataset_id: 43300.0
description: The PhosphoproteinChallenge_DREAM3 dataset is a collection of protein phosphorylation data provided by the DREAM project. It consists of protein expression levels and phosphorylation measurements for a set of proteins in different conditions. The dataset includes measurements for both stimulated and unstimulated cells, allowing for the analysis of cell response to certain conditions. The dataset contains information on a variety of proteins, including their primary sequences, annotation data, and phosphosite modifications. It also provides information on the data source, experimental setup, and experimental methods used to generate the dataset. The dataset is intended to be used for benchmarking and evaluating computational methods for predicting protein phosphorylation.
