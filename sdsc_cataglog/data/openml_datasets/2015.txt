name: QSAR-TID-100042
dataset_id: 4001.0
description: QSAR-TID-100042 is a dataset containing information about the toxicity of chemical compounds towards Daphnia Magna, a water flea. The dataset consists of 105 records, with each record containing 7 features and a binary class variable indicating toxicity. The features include chemical descriptors such as molecular weight, atomic properties, and topological indices. The dataset focuses on the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling of the compounds. QSAR models can help predict the toxicity of new chemicals based on their structure and properties, aiding in the design of safer compounds. The dataset can be used for machine learning and data analysis purposes in the field of toxicology and chemistry.
