name: ringnorm
dataset_id: 1496.0
description: The dataset ringnorm consists of 20,000 instances with each instance having 20 numeric features. It is a binary classification problem where the target variable can be either 0 or 1. The dataset is generated by placing two concentric circles in such a way that the inner circle represents class 0 and the outer circle represents class 1. The instances are uniformly distributed along the circles with some added Gaussian noise. The goal is to predict the correct class for a given set of features. It is commonly used as a benchmark dataset in pattern recognition and machine learning tasks.
