name: QSAR-TID-10616
dataset_id: 3498.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10616 contains 881 compounds, with each compound represented by 287 physicochemical descriptors. The descriptors include molecular weight, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor counts, and various structural features. The dataset aims to predict the inhibition constant (logKi) values of compounds targeting the enzyme Thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRß). These values indicate the compound's ability to inhibit TRß activity. The dataset also includes binary outcomes indicating the absence or presence of cytotoxicity. QSAR-TID-10616 serves as a valuable resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity and toxicological effects of compounds targeting TRß.
