name: QSAR-TID-175
dataset_id: 3462.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-175 consists of 175 chemical compounds with measurements of their toxicity levels. These compounds belong to the class "amphibian" and were tested for their ability to cause developmental abnormalities in frog embryos. The data includes 574 molecular descriptors, such as chemical properties and structural characteristics. The toxicity levels were determined using a bioassay, which measures the concentration at which 50% of the embryos exhibit abnormalities. The goal of the dataset is to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model that can predict the toxicity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors, helping in the identification of potentially harmful substances.
