name: SoilKsatDB
dataset_id: 42332.0
description: SoilKsatDB is a dataset that provides information about soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat). It contains data from various sources across the globe and covers a wide range of soil types and conditions. The dataset includes measurements of Ksat at different depths, such as surface and subsurface, and provides information about the methodology used to obtain the data. SoilKsatDB aims to improve the understanding of soil hydraulic properties and their variability, which is crucial for areas like hydrology, agriculture, and environmental modeling. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed for research and analytical purposes.
