name: QSAR-TID-11064
dataset_id: 4036.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11064 consists of chemical compounds, their molecular properties, and their biological activities against a specific target. It contains 4,149 instances and 1,026 features, including 1,025 descriptors and 1 target variable. All features are represented by real values, and the target variable is a binary classification indicating the biological activity of the compound. The dataset was created for developing predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular properties. It can be used for classification tasks and evaluating the performance of QSAR models.
