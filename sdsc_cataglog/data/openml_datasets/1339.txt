name: QSAR-TID-12476
dataset_id: 3316.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12476 consists of 7,563 compounds with molecular descriptors and their biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The dataset includes 55 molecular descriptors that describe the compounds' physicochemical properties and structural characteristics. The biological activity of the compounds is measured using a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) assay. The dataset also provides information on the potency, efficacy, and toxicity of the compounds. It aims to aid in the development of potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment by identifying compounds with high antiviral activity. The dataset is freely available for research purposes.
