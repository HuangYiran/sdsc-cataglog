name: QSAR-TID-20007
dataset_id: 3541.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-20007 contains information related to the properties of different chemical compounds. It consists of 1513 instances and 729 attributes. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a compound is active or inactive. The dataset provides details about the molecular structure of each compound, including features such as atomic properties, topological indices, and geometrical descriptors. Additionally, it includes information about the experimental activity of each compound. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship models, which can predict the activity of new compounds based on their molecular structure.
