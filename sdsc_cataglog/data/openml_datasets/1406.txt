name: QSAR-TID-104385
dataset_id: 3386.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-104385 is a collection of 1,432 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. Each compound is represented by numerous molecular descriptors such as hydrophobicity, electronegativity, and molecular weight. The dataset provides information on whether each compound is active or inactive against a particular target protein. The compounds were obtained from the ChEMBL database and annotated with their biological activities from bioassays conducted by the European Bioinformatics Institute. This dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
