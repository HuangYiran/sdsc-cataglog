dataset_id: 42003.0
description: The iris dataset is a popular and widely used dataset in machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of four features of three different species of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The purpose of this dataset is to classify different species of iris flowers based on these measurements. The dataset consists of 150 observations, with 50 samples from each of the three species. It is often used as a benchmark for classification algorithms and has been extensively studied in the field of pattern recognition. Overall, the iris dataset serves as an important resource for various statistical and machine learning tasks.
