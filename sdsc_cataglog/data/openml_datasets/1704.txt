name: QSAR-TID-11281
dataset_id: 3687.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11281 consists of 183 compounds with 8 chemical properties and a binary classification target variable indicating their toxicity. The compounds were selected from a larger set of molecules based on their structural diversity and toxicity data availability. The chemical properties include molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, rotatable bonds count, and others. The target variable classifies the compounds as either non-toxic (class 0) or toxic (class 1). This dataset can be used for developing predictive models and exploring the relationship between chemical properties and toxicity of compounds.
