name: ecoli
dataset_id: 39.0
description: The ecoli dataset is a collection of data that provides information on various aspects of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium. It primarily focuses on the proteins present in different strains of E. coli and their localization sites within the cell. The dataset contains 336 samples with nine attributes describing the sequences' amino acid and other relevant properties. Additionally, it includes a class attribute specifying the protein's localization site. The dataset's purpose is to aid in the development of machine learning algorithms capable of predicting the localization site of E. coli proteins based on their attributes.
