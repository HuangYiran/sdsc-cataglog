name: QSAR-TID-12135
dataset_id: 3970.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12135 contains information relevant to the prediction of toxic effects of various compounds. It includes 1,522 organic compounds characterized by 88 molecular descriptors, along with their corresponding toxicological activity values. This dataset aims to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The descriptors cover various molecular properties such as electronegativity, polarizability, hydrophobicity, and molecular weight. Toxicological activity values represent the toxicity expressed as a logarithm of the lethal concentration of each compound. This dataset provides valuable insights for researchers working on toxicity prediction and building QSAR models for compound evaluation.
