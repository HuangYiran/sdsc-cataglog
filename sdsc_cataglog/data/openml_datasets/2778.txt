name: Duffing_system_phase_transition
dataset_id: 42203.0
description: The Duffing_system_phase_transition dataset is a collection of numerical simulations of the Duffing system, a nonlinear dynamical system represented by a second-order differential equation. The dataset consists of time series data for various parameters representing the system's behavior. Each simulation runs for a specific time duration with a time step and includes information such as the system's position, velocity, and energy. The purpose of this dataset is to study the phase transition phenomenon by analyzing the dynamical behavior of the Duffing system for different parameter values. The dataset is openly available and can be used for research purposes in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and condensed matter physics.
