dataset_id: 3300.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12587 contains information about 3987 chemical compounds, including their structural attributes and their respective bioactivity levels against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The main goal of this dataset is the prediction of the molecules' inhibition activity against HIV. It includes 41 molecular descriptors that represent different features of the compounds, such as topological indices, constitutional descriptors, functional group count, and physicochemical properties. Additionally, the dataset provides binary output, indicating whether the compounds are active or not against HIV. This dataset would be useful for developing predictive models to identify potential molecules with anti-HIV properties.
