description: The kidney dataset contains information on kidney patients, their diagnosis, laboratory test results, and medication details. It includes data on 400 patients, with attributes such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, albumin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and sodium levels. The dataset allows for the prediction and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on these attributes. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of CKD. The dataset also provides information on the type of kidney disease, with labels for each type. The data can be utilized to develop algorithms and models for CKD diagnosis and prognosis.
