description: The dataset segment is used to divide a larger dataset into smaller, manageable subsets for analysis and processing. This technique helps researchers and analysts work with a manageable portion of data at a time instead of dealing with a massive dataset all at once. Segmentation is driven by factors such as size, content, or time, which allow for efficient data handling. Splitting data into segments enables parallel processing, better performance, and distributed analysis. Each segment retains a portion of the original dataset's essential characteristics, ensuring accuracy and representativeness. They can be analyzed independently or combined with other segments for comprehensive insights and decision-making.
