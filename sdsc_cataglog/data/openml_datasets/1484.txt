name: QSAR-TID-10688
dataset_id: 3466.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10688 dataset focuses on the prediction of aquatic toxicity levels, particularly towards algae. It contains 10688 different molecules and their corresponding chemical descriptors, along with the experimentally measured toxicity values towards algae. This dataset aims to support research on developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicity of new chemical compounds. The chemical descriptors provide information about the molecular structure and properties, while the toxicity values represent the adverse effects on algae. By analyzing this dataset, researchers can explore patterns and relationships between the chemical descriptors and toxicity levels, aiding in the development of efficient and accurate toxicity prediction models.
