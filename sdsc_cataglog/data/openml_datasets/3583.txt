name: Breast-cancer-gene-expression---CuMiDa
dataset_id: 43658.0
description: The dataset "Breast-cancer-gene-expression---CuMiDa" consists of gene expression data collected from breast cancer tissues. It includes information on the expression levels of several genes in samples obtained from patients with different subtypes of breast cancer. The dataset also contains clinical data such as age, tumor stage, and histological grade of the patients. This dataset aims to facilitate the identification of gene expression patterns that may be associated with specific breast cancer subtypes, helping to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. The availability of both gene expression and clinical data makes it valuable for various research and analysis purposes in the field of breast cancer study.
