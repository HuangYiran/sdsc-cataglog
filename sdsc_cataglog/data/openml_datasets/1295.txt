name: QSAR-TID-12169
dataset_id: 3271.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12169 contains molecular descriptors and corresponding target values of compounds. The molecular descriptors represent various characteristics of the compounds, such as size, shape, and chemical properties. The target values indicate the biological activity of the compounds, specifically with respect to their ability to inhibit a certain enzyme. The dataset aims to predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. It is useful for researchers in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry to understand and design compounds with desired biological activity. The dataset consists of 121 compounds, each described by 574 molecular descriptors, making it suitable for machine learning and predictive modeling tasks.
