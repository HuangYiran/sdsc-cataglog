description: The train dataset consists of a large collection of labeled examples that are used to train machine learning models. These examples are made up of various features and their corresponding target values. The dataset is typically divided into two parts, the training set and the validation set. The training set is used to train the model, and the validation set is used to assess the model's performance. The train dataset can be preprocessed and transformed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data issues. It is crucial to have a well-organized and representative train dataset to build accurate and reliable machine learning models.
