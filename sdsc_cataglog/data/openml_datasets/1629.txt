name: QSAR-TID-20166
dataset_id: 3614.0
description: QSAR-TID-20166 is a dataset that contains information related to the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling of bioconcentration factor (BCF) values for various organic compounds. The dataset comprises 8,281 compounds and 377 molecular descriptors. The molecular descriptors encompass a variety of features including constitutional, topological, geometrical, and electronic properties. The dataset is obtained from the literature and curated to ensure accuracy and consistency. The BCF values represent the tendency of a compound to accumulate in an organism based on its chemical properties. This dataset can be utilized for QSAR modeling and developing predictive models to estimate BCF values for new compounds.
