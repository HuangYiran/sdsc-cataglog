name: kc1
dataset_id: 1067.0
description: The KC1 dataset is a software defect prediction dataset that consists of 2109 instances and 22 attributes. It is collected from four open-source projects implemented in the Java programming language. The dataset contains information about software metrics and defects, such as McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, and defect density. The goal of this dataset is to predict software defects based on these attributes. It is widely used in research on software defect prediction techniques and has been benchmarked against various machine learning models. The dataset provides a valuable resource for studying and developing accurate software defect prediction models.
