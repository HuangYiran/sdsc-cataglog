description: The dataset LoanDefaultPrediction contains information about loan applicants and their repayment abilities. It includes both numerical and categorical features such as age, income, employment history, loan amount, and credit score. The target variable is a binary label that indicates whether the applicant defaulted on their loan or not. The dataset is balanced, with approximately equal numbers of default and non-default cases. The aim is to use the given features to predict whether an applicant will default on their loan. This dataset provides an opportunity to develop a predictive model that can help financial institutions assess the risk of loan defaults and make informed lending decisions.
