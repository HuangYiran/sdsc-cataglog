name: covertype
dataset_id: 180.0
description: The dataset covertype includes information on the type of forest cover in a specific region of the US and is commonly used in classification tasks. It consists of 581,012 data points, each containing 54 attributes, including cartographic variables and environmental features. The data covers seven different forest cover types and is evenly distributed among them. The dataset has been widely used in machine learning research to develop models for predicting forest cover type based on the given attributes. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms in the field of remote sensing and land cover mapping.
