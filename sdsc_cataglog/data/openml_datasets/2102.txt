name: QSAR-TID-30036
dataset_id: 4088.0
description: The QSAR-TID-30036 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds used for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling. It consists of 3,036 compounds with associated activities against a specific biological target. The dataset contains a variety of molecular descriptors that characterize the chemical properties of the compounds, including topological, electrostatic, and thermodynamic descriptors. The compounds were divided into training and test sets for model development and evaluation, respectively. This dataset is useful for developing QSAR models to predict the activity of new compounds against the given target, aiding in the discovery and design of potent and selective drugs.
