name: QSAR-TID-11154
dataset_id: 3472.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11154 consists of 932 chemical compounds that were extracted from a publicly available database. These compounds were  evaluated for their  potential to act as an anti-HIV therapeutic. The chemical structures of these compounds were represented using molecular descriptors. Multiple regression analysis was then performed to correlate the molecular descriptors to an activity value, indicating the anti-HIV potency of each compound. The dataset also includes additional information about the compounds, such as their empirical formula and molecular weight. This dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying anti-HIV drug discovery and can aid in the development of more effective therapeutic agents.
