description: The breast-cancer-dropped-missing-attributes-values dataset is a modified version of the widely used "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset. It contains 569 instances with 30 attributes, excluding the patient ID. The original dataset had 16 missing attribute values, which were dropped in this modified version. The attributes consist of various features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more, representing characteristics of cell nuclei extracted from breast masses. The dataset aims to be used for classification tasks related to breast cancer diagnosis, where the target is to classify tumor cells as either malignant or benign.
