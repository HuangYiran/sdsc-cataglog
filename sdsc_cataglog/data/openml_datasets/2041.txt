name: QSAR-TID-11907
dataset_id: 4027.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11907 contains information on the biological activity of various compounds against a specific target. It consists of 2,570 compounds and 504 molecular descriptors. The biological activity is represented by the pIC50 value, which indicates the compound's inhibitory potency. The dataset was obtained from a study aiming to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of compounds. The molecular descriptors include features such as size, shape, and chemical properties of the compounds. This dataset can be used for developing models to predict the inhibitory potency of new compounds against the target.
