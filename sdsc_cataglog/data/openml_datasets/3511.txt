name: UCI-SECOM-Dataset
dataset_id: 43587.0
description: The UCI-SECOM-Dataset is a publicly available dataset developed by the University of California, Irvine (UCI). It consists of sensor readings from a semiconductor manufacturing process, aimed at detecting and diagnosing faults. The dataset contains 1,565 instances of measurements with 590 attributes, including 104 failures. Each instance is labeled as either normal or includes a specific type of failure. The data collection spanned over a period of 10 months, making it useful for time series analysis and predictive modeling. It is often used by researchers and practitioners to develop algorithms for fault detection and predictive maintenance in manufacturing processes.
