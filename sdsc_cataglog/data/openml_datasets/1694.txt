name: QSAR-TID-11635
dataset_id: 3677.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11635 contains information on the potency of compounds in inhibiting the HIV-1 protease enzyme. It consists of 1,436 chemical compounds and their respective activities represented through IC50 values (the concentration of the compound required to inhibit the enzyme activity by 50%). The compounds were divided into two classes based on their HIV-1 protease inhibitory activities: active compounds (143) and inactive compounds (1,293). Multiple molecular descriptors were calculated for each compound, including topological, geometrical, and quantum chemical descriptors. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of predictive models to determine the HIV-1 protease inhibitory activity of new compounds using computational techniques.
