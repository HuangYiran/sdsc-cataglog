name: QSAR-TID-11451
dataset_id: 3088.0
description: QSAR-TID-11451 is a dataset consisting of 4,951 chemical compounds. It contains a total of 134 molecular descriptors, including topological, shape, electrotopological, and global properties. The descriptors provide detailed information about the compounds' molecular structure and characteristics. The dataset also includes the measured toxicity response of each compound, indicating its level of harm or danger. QSAR-TID-11451 is a valuable resource for conducting studies related to quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and toxicity prediction models. It allows researchers to analyze the relationship between molecular descriptors and toxicity responses, potentially aiding in the development of novel drugs and chemicals with reduced toxic effects.
