name: QSAR-TID-103561
dataset_id: 3084.0
description: The QSAR-TID-103561 dataset contains information about a series of compounds and their biological activity towards a specific protein target. It includes descriptors or features such as molecular properties and structural information, as well as the corresponding activity values for each compound. The dataset aims to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new compounds. The dataset also comes with a predefined split of compounds into training and test sets. This dataset can be used by researchers in drug discovery and development, as well as in the field of computational chemistry to develop reliable predictive models.
