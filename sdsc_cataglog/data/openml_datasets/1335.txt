name: QSAR-TID-10901
dataset_id: 3312.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10901 contains information related to the chemical compounds along with their corresponding toxicity values. It consists of a total of 1585 chemical compounds, each represented by 1024 molecular descriptors. These descriptors include properties such as molecular weight, polarizability, and hydrophobicity, providing insights into the chemical characteristics of the compounds. The toxicity values indicate the level of toxicity displayed by each compound. The dataset can be useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of unknown chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. It can aid in the identification and evaluation of potentially harmful substances.
