description: The dataset CreditCardFraudDetection is a comprehensive collection of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset contains two days' worth of transactions, with a total of 284,807 instances. Out of these, only 492 transactions are identified as fraudulent, making it highly imbalanced. The dataset includes 28 features, with most of them anonymized due to privacy concerns. The time feature represents the seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. Other features include transaction amounts and information from principal component analysis (PCA) transformed variables. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for evaluating and developing fraud detection algorithms.
