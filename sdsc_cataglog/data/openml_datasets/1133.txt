name: QSAR-TID-10227
dataset_id: 3109.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10227 dataset includes data on the chronic inhalation toxicity of 644 chemicals. It contains a total of 101 descriptors for each chemical, as well as the corresponding experimental endpoint values, which indicate the level of toxicity. The dataset was compiled through a research project that evaluated the inhalation toxicity of various chemicals using a specific experimental protocol. The purpose of this dataset is to allow researchers to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicological properties of new chemicals. It can be used in computational toxicology research and the development of alternative testing methods for chemical safety assessment.
