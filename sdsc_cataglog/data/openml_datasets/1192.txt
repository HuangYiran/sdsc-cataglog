name: QSAR-TID-100869
dataset_id: 3168.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100869 consists of 8,869 chemical compounds, each having 41 molecular descriptors and an experimental biological activity value. The dataset aims to predict the acute aquatic toxicity of chemical compounds, which is crucial in evaluating their environmental impact. The biological activity value represents the concentration at which 50% of the test organisms are affected, allowing for toxicity classification. The molecular descriptors include features such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and topological indexes. QSAR-TID-100869 offers a valuable resource for developing Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of chemical compounds, aiding in early screening and assessment of potential environmental hazards.
