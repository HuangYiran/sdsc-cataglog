name: QSAR-TID-12244
dataset_id: 4018.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12244 dataset contains molecular descriptors and their biological activities for a group of compounds. The dataset was created for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. It consists of 783 compounds with 2182 descriptors, including 1980 derived from the 2D structure and 202 computed from the 3D structure of the molecules. The biological activities of the compounds were measured against a specific target. The dataset aims to assist researchers in predicting the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular features using machine learning and computational modeling techniques.
