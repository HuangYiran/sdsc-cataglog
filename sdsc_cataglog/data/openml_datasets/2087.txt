name: QSAR-TID-17023
dataset_id: 4073.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17023 contains information on 4,305 organic compounds and their corresponding inhibitory activity against thrombin, an important enzyme in blood clotting. The data is divided into 29 molecular descriptors that describe the compounds' physicochemical properties. The dataset also includes the compounds' molecular structures represented by Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation, which allows for easier computational analysis. The dataset aims to serve as a resource for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds against thrombin. This information can be valuable in drug development and designing potential thrombin inhibitors.
