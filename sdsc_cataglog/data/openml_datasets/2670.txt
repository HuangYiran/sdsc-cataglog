name: GTSRB-HOG01
dataset_id: 41986.0
description: The GTSRB-HOG01 dataset is a collection of images of traffic signs, primarily focusing on traffic sign recognition. It consists of 43 different classes of traffic signs, containing a total of 39,209 images. The images are labeled and organized into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Each image has a resolution of 32x32 pixels. The dataset also includes pre-extracted and preprocessed Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, which represent the shape and texture information of the traffic signs. The GTSRB-HOG01 dataset is commonly used for training and evaluating algorithms and models for traffic sign recognition tasks.
