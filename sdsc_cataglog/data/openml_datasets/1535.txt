name: QSAR-TID-12809
dataset_id: 3519.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12809 is composed of 5,100 compounds, each represented by 214 molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide information about different aspects of the compounds' chemical structures and properties. The dataset includes a target variable indicating the compounds' activity values against a specific protein target. The compounds are divided into three classes based on their activity values: active, inactive, and inconclusive. The dataset's goal is to predict compound activity and aid in drug discovery. The QSAR-TID-12809 dataset has been used in machine learning studies to develop models for predicting compound activity by analyzing the descriptor values.
