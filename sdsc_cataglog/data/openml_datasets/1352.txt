name: QSAR-TID-104138
dataset_id: 3329.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-104138 contains information about the biological activity of a set of compounds. It consists of 105 compounds and 96 molecular descriptors. The dataset also includes the binary outcome variable denoting the biological activity of each compound. The descriptors were generated using software DRAGON and represent various physicochemical properties of the compounds. This dataset aims to facilitate research in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. It provides a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of predictive models to understand the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity.
