name: QSAR-TID-17121
dataset_id: 3921.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17121 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It consists of 1055 instances, with each instance containing 439 features and a binary label indicating the compound's activity. The dataset is primarily used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict a compound's activity based on its chemical structure. The dataset is publicly available and has been widely used in research for developing machine learning models and algorithms in drug design and discovery. It provides a valuable resource for exploring the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity.
