name: QSAR-TID-11891
dataset_id: 4074.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11891 consists of 591 samples with 1,114 molecular descriptors and a binary outcome variable indicating the cytotoxic activity of compounds against yeast cells. The descriptors include topological, constitutional, and electrostatic properties as well as atomic and drug-like properties. The dataset is aimed at developing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to predict cytotoxic activity. The data has been preprocessed to remove missing values and correlated descriptors. QSAR-TID-11891 is publicly available and has been used in various studies to develop and validate QSAR models in drug discovery and toxicology.
