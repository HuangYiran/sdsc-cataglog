name: QSAR-TID-101359
dataset_id: 3135.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101359 contains information about the biological activity of various compounds. It consists of 178 observations, each with 41 descriptors and a target variable representing the activity level. The descriptors include molecular properties like presence of certain functional groups, as well as physicochemical properties. The target variable classifies the compounds as either active or inactive. The dataset was originally created to train machine learning models for predicting the activity of new compounds. It can be used for tasks like classification, regression, and feature selection. The dataset is openly available and has been used in various research studies and competitions in the field of chemoinformatics.
