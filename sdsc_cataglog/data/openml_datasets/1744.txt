name: QSAR-TID-12076
dataset_id: 3727.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12076 dataset contains data related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of chemical compounds. It focuses specifically on compounds that might have an impact on the toxicity of aquatic organisms, such as fish. The dataset includes information on 9,721 chemical compounds and their associated activity levels, along with 203 molecular descriptors that characterize their structural properties. These descriptors cover features like bond counts, molecular weight, and topological indices. The dataset aims to provide insights into the relationship between chemical structure and aquatic toxicity, enabling the development of predictive models and identification of potentially harmful compounds.
