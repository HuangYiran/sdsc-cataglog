name: QSAR-TID-17005
dataset_id: 3534.0
description: The QSAR-TID-17005 dataset comprises molecular descriptors of 4,299 organic molecules. These descriptors are used to predict the toxicological hazard associated with these molecules. The dataset includes a binary classification indicating whether the molecule is toxic or non-toxic. The molecules were selected from a larger dataset of 2.2 million compounds and are represented by 1,277 molecular descriptors generated by the Dragon software. The dataset is relevant for building models to predict the toxicity of organic molecules and can aid in drug discovery and chemical safety assessment. The dataset is freely available and maintained by the QSAR and Chemoinformatics Society.
