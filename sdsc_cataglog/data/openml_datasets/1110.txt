name: QSAR-TID-30007
dataset_id: 3086.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30007 consists of molecular descriptors and target variables related to 785 organic compounds. The molecular descriptors include information about the chemical structure and properties of the compounds, while the target variables represent their biological activity towards a specific target. The dataset is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, which aims to establish a relationship between the molecular features and the biological activity of the compounds. It can be utilized in various applications, such as drug design and toxicity prediction. The dataset provides an opportunity for researchers to explore and develop computational models for predicting the activity of organic compounds.
