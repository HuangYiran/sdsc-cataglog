name: QSAR-TID-12780
dataset_id: 3834.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12780 dataset contains chemical, physical, and biological data for 12780 compounds used to create quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The dataset includes 474 attributes, including information about molecular structure, physical properties, and bioactivity data. The compounds have been tested against a specific receptor, and their bioactivity is measured as an inhibitory concentration. The dataset also includes information on the compounds' molecular formula, chirality, and presence of specific functional groups. The data is diverse and enables the development of QSAR models to predict bioactivity against the receptor of interest.
