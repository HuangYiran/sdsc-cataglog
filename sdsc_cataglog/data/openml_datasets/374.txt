name: fri_c4_1000_10
dataset_id: 623.0
description: The dataset fri_c4_1000_10 is a collection of approximately 1000 instances, where each instance consists of 10 attributes. This dataset contains categorical data. It is derived from the FriC4.5 dataset, which was transformed to have binary attributes. The original dataset was created for the evaluation of rule induction algorithms. The fri_c4_1000_10 dataset serves as a benchmark for supervised rule learning and classification tasks. With its manageable size and balanced distribution of instances, it provides a useful resource for testing and comparing different rule-based algorithms and machine learning models.
