name: QSAR-TID-17113
dataset_id: 4106.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17113 consists of 4,777 chemical compounds, each described by 1,171 numerical molecular descriptors. These compounds have been categorized into two classes: active molecules and inactive molecules. The dataset aims to predict whether a compound is active or inactive based on its molecular descriptors. The dataset has been created by retrieving chemicals from the ChEMBL database and filtering them based on various criteria. The dataset is useful for developing machine learning models to study the relationship between molecular descriptors and compound activity, potentially aiding in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry research.
