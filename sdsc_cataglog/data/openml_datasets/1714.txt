dataset_id: 3697.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11629 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding activities against specific biological targets. It contains 1574 compounds with each having information on 10 molecular descriptors that represent their physical and chemical properties. The dataset also provides the binary outcome of the compounds, indicating whether they are active or inactive against the target. The goal of this dataset is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify compounds based on their descriptors and activities. It can be used for various purposes such as drug discovery and toxicology assessments.
