name: QSAR-TID-12868
dataset_id: 3536.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12868 dataset consists of molecular descriptors and biological activities of a set of chemical compounds. It was created to develop Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the biological activities of new compounds. The dataset contains 12868 compounds, each described by 426 molecular descriptors. The descriptors include various chemical properties such as topological, electrostatic, and thermodynamic properties. The biological activities are represented as continuous values and span a wide range, making it suitable for regression modeling. This dataset can be used by researchers to develop QSAR models and explore the relationship between molecular properties and biological activities.
