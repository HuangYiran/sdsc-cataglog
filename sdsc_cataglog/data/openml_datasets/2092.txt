name: QSAR-TID-12699
dataset_id: 4078.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12699 consists of 4,300 chemical compounds and their corresponding experimental and predicted toxicities towards rats. The compounds have been structurally characterized by their SMILES notations and are represented by a total of 228 descriptors. The dataset also includes the actual toxicity values observed in the experiments and the predicted toxicity values obtained using the Support Vector Machine regression approach. The dataset aims to help in developing computational models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds towards rats and can be used for regression analysis or machine learning tasks in the field of toxicology.
