dataset_id: 676.0
description: The dataset "disclosure_x_tampered" contains tampered versions of the original dataset "disclosure_x". These tampered versions aim to mimic real-world scenarios where data might be manipulated or altered. The dataset includes various types of alterations such as noise injection, feature distortion, and label modifications. It was created to evaluate models' robustness and performance in the presence of manipulated data. The tampered dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to assess the vulnerabilities of their machine learning models and develop strategies to mitigate the impact of tampered data on their systems.
