name: ECG5000
dataset_id: 44794.0
description: The ECG5000 dataset contains 5,000 records of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The signals are collected from 12 leads, representing different parts of the heart. The data includes both normal and abnormal ECG patterns, making it suitable for classification tasks related to arrhythmia detection. Each record consists of 1,400 points sampled at 250 Hz. The dataset also includes annotations indicating the presence of different types of arrhythmias. It can be used for various tasks such as heartbeat classification, arrhythmia detection, and ECG signal analysis. The dataset is widely used in the field of biomedical signal processing and machine learning for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prediction.
