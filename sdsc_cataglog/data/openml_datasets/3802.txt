description: The Diabetes-130-Hospitals dataset, available in the Fairlearn library, provides information related to diabetes treatment outcomes across multiple hospitals. It comprises data from 130 hospitals over 10 years, with numerous features including patient demographics, medical history, and medications. The dataset focuses on factors that may influence the rate of readmission within 30 days of discharge. With such a large and diverse dataset, it serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the complexities associated with diabetes treatment and readmission rates. The dataset aims to aid in the development of fair and unbiased machine learning models for predicting readmission risks and implementing responsible healthcare practices.
