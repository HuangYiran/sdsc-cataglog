dataset_id: 958.0
description: The dataset segment consists of a collection of data that is organized into different categories or subsets based on common characteristics or attributes. It is used in data analysis and research to understand and explore specific aspects of the overall dataset. The segment is typically created by filtering or partitioning the data based on specific criteria or variables. The purpose of creating dataset segments is to focus on a particular subset of data for in-depth analysis, comparison, or modeling. By studying smaller segments, researchers can gain insights into patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be apparent in the entire dataset.
