name: LoanDefaultPrediction
dataset_id: 6331.0
description: The dataset LoanDefaultPrediction is used for predicting whether a loan will default or not. It consists of various features including loan amount, interest rate, employment status, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio. The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether the loan defaulted or not. The dataset has around 100,000 observations and is highly imbalanced, with a small proportion of default cases. The dataset requires preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and categorical variables. The goal is to train a machine learning model on this dataset to predict the probability of loan default and help lenders assess the risk associated with granting loans.
