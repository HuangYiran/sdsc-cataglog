name: fourclass_scale
dataset_id: 1571.0
description: The dataset fourclass_scale contains data related to a classification problem. It includes 600 instances with 18 attributes. The attributes describe various characteristics of the instances such as size, shape, and color. Each instance belongs to one of four different classes: '1', '2', '3', or '4'. The dataset is scaled, meaning the attribute values have been normalized to a range between -1 and 1. This dataset can be used for training machine learning models to predict the class of new instances based on their attributes.
