name: QSAR-TID-11003
dataset_id: 3535.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11003 is a compilation of chemical compounds represented by their molecular structure and various descriptors. It consists of 4710 instances and 1024 attributes, with the last attribute being the activity class of the compound. The dataset was used for predicting acute aquatic toxicity, which is the lethality of these compounds to the aquatic environment. The compounds were obtained from various sources and subjected to various experimental conditions to measure their toxicity. The dataset is provided as a tool for developing QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models to predict the toxicity of new chemical compounds before actual experiments.
