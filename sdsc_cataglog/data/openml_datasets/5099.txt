name: simulated_covertype
dataset_id: 45640.0
description: The simulated_covertype dataset contains information about various forest cover types. It includes data related to attributes such as elevation, aspect, slope, soil type, and wilderness area. The dataset is divided into multiple sections, including the covertype section which contains information about seven different cover types. Each cover type is associated with a set of attributes. Additionally, the dataset also includes information about the actual observed cover type and the predicted cover type based on a decision tree model. The simulated_covertype dataset is widely used in machine learning and classification tasks related to forest cover analysis.
