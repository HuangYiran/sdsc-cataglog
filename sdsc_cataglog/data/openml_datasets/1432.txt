name: QSAR-TID-11364
dataset_id: 3412.0
description: QSAR-TID-11364 is a dataset consisting of 11,364 compounds with their corresponding 1D and 2D molecular descriptors. These descriptors are calculated based on the chemical structure of the compounds and provide information about their physicochemical and structural properties. The dataset also includes a binary classification variable indicating the compound's biological activity (active or inactive) against a specific protein target. The aim of this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds. The dataset has been extensively used in the field of chemoinformatics to evaluate and compare different machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods.
