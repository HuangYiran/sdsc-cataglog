name: spectrometer
dataset_id: 954.0
description: The dataset spectrometer is a collection of data measured by a spectrometer, an instrument that analyzes light interactions with matter. It allows researchers to study and interpret various characteristics of the analyzed material based on its spectral properties. The data in this dataset can include wavelengths, intensities, and other relevant parameters. It provides a valuable resource for understanding chemical compositions, identifying substances, and detecting specific properties of materials. The dataset spectrometer enables scientists to explore the electromagnetic spectrum and make meaningful observations and investigations in a wide range of fields such as chemistry, physics, materials science, and environmental studies.
