name: steel-plates-fault
dataset_id: 40982.0
description: The steel-plates-fault dataset contains data related to the fault types present in steel plates. There are a total of 1941 instances and 27 attributes in the dataset. The attributes include geometric features such as length, width, and thickness, along with others like orientation, edge count, and concavity. The dataset has seven types of faults, namely Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, and Other_Faults. The instances are evenly distributed among these different fault types. The dataset aims to assist in the development of fault detection and classification algorithms for steel plates.
