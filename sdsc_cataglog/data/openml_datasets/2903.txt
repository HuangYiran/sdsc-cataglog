name: Test_vectors_trans_posneg
dataset_id: 42550.0
description: The dataset Test_vectors_trans_posneg contains transformed vectors representing positive and negative sentences. The vectors are produced using a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of sentences. Each sentence is transformed into a numerical vector, which captures its semantic meaning. The positive sentences in the dataset represent constructive or favorable statements, while the negative sentences represent critical or unfavorable statements. The dataset is suitable for various natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and generating embeddings for sentence-level analysis.
