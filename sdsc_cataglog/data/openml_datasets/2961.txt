name: dataset_time_3
dataset_id: 42647.0
description: The dataset dataset_time_3 contains information about the time taken by an algorithm to solve a problem for different input sizes. The dataset includes 1000 records, each representing a combination of different input sizes and the corresponding time taken by the algorithm to solve them. The input sizes range from 10 to 1000 elements. The purpose of the dataset is to analyze the relationship between input size and algorithm runtime. The dataset also includes additional attributes such as the number of iterations performed by the algorithm and the memory used. The dataset_time_3 offers valuable insights into algorithm performance and helps in understanding the scalability of the algorithm with increasing input sizes.
