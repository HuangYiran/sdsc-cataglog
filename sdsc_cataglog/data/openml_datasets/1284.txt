name: QSAR-TID-100860
dataset_id: 3260.0
description: The QSAR-TID-100860 dataset consists of 356 chemicals with their respective molecular descriptors and biological activity values. The data was obtained through quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, which aim to predict the biological activity of a compound based on its structural features. The molecular descriptors include information about the chemical's size, shape, and other properties. The dataset is mainly used for classification tasks, where the goal is to classify a chemical as active or inactive based on its descriptors. It is valuable for developing models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds, aiding in drug discovery and design processes.
