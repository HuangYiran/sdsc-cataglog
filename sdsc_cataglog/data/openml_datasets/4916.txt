name: PASS
dataset_id: 45274.0
description: The PASS dataset is a comprehensive and heterogeneous dataset that contains a wide range of information related to protein structures. It includes highly accurate geometric descriptions of protein structures, predictions of protein folding, and residue-level annotations. The dataset consists of both experimentally determined protein structures and computationally predicted models. It also includes information about protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and disease-related mutations. The PASS dataset encompasses a diverse and comprehensive collection of protein structure information, making it a valuable resource for studying protein structure, function, and the relationship between protein sequence and structure.
