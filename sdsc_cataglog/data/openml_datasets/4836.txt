name: hepar2_8
dataset_id: 45194.0
description: The dataset hepar2_8 is a collection of sparse timeseries derived from the HEPAR-II trial, which aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of heparin in critically ill patients. The dataset contains 450 patients' data, with each patient having a varying number of sparse time series measurements. The measurements include data related to heparin administration, such as dosage and infusion rate, along with other patient-specific variables such as age, gender, and weight. The dataset also includes information about patient outcomes, such as the occurrence of bleeding incidents. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of heparin in critically ill patients.
