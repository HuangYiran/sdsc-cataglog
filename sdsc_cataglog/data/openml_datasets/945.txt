name: climate-model-simulation-crashes
dataset_id: 1467.0
description: The dataset climate-model-simulation-crashes contains information about crashes that occur during climate model simulations. It includes data on the time stamp of the crash, the temperature, and the pressure at the time of the crash. The dataset also includes information about the specific climate model used, the version of the model, and the specific simulation that resulted in the crash. There are a total of 10,000 entries in the dataset, each representing a unique crash event. This dataset can be used to analyze the causes of crashes during climate model simulations and develop strategies to improve the stability and reliability of these simulations.
