description: The leukemia dataset is a collection of genetic expression data from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. The dataset contains information on gene expression levels for thousands of genes in AML patients, as well as clinical and cytogenetic data. It includes samples from various subtypes of AML, including those with specific genetic abnormalities or mutations. The dataset is widely used in research to study the molecular mechanisms and potential targets for treatment of AML, aiming to improve patient outcomes and develop personalized therapies.
