name: IEEE80211aa-GATS
dataset_id: 43256.0
description: The dataset IEEE80211aa-GATS is a collection of connection-level measurements for IEEE 802.11aa link adaptation mechanisms. It comprises measurements from 26 different link adaptation algorithms, gathered in an indoor office environment. The dataset includes more than 20,000 connection-level measurements with each measurement containing information such as the received signal strength, data rate, and transmission time. The measurements were collected using commercial Wi-Fi cards and include a wide range of network conditions, making it suitable for evaluating and comparing different link adaptation algorithms. The dataset is available for public access and can be useful for researchers working on improving Wi-Fi performance and link adaptation mechanisms.
