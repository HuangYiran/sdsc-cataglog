name: QSAR-TID-12163
dataset_id: 3298.0
description: The dataset "QSAR-TID-12163" contains information related to the toxicity of chemical compounds. It consists of 4219 instances with 1024 features, representing molecular descriptors used to predict the toxicological properties. The molecular descriptors provide information on different aspects of the compound's structure, such as the presence of functional groups and atom connectivity. The dataset also includes toxicity labels ranging from 0 (non-toxic) to 10 (highly toxic), which are used as targets for prediction models. Additionally, there is a class imbalance in the dataset, with most instances representing non-toxic compounds. The dataset offers a valuable resource for developing models to predict chemical compound toxicity.
