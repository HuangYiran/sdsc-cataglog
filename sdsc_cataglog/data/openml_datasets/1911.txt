name: QSAR-TID-100824
dataset_id: 3896.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100824 consists of information on 439 molecules. Each molecule is described by 1024 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values representing various characteristics of the molecule. The dataset also includes a binary target variable, indicating whether the molecule is active or inactive against a specific protein target. The data has been preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. The objective of this dataset is to develop a predictive model to determine the activity of molecules against the protein target based on their molecular descriptors. This dataset can be helpful in the field of drug discovery and design.
