name: QSAR-TID-100127
dataset_id: 3311.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100127 is an important resource for drug discovery and development. It contains information about the biological activity of 1,700 compounds that have been tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The dataset includes 42 molecular descriptors that are used to characterize the compounds' chemical properties. These descriptors provide valuable insights into the compounds' structure-activity relationship, allowing researchers to predict the efficacy of potential new drugs. The dataset also includes the compounds' activity values, which represent their effectiveness against HIV-1. QSAR-TID-100127 is widely used by researchers in the field to develop new therapeutic interventions against HIV-1.
