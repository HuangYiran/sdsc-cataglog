name: QSAR-TID-12933
dataset_id: 3295.0
description: QSAR-TID-12933 is a dataset that contains information on the biological activity of various molecules. The dataset consists of 18,054 instances and 7 features, including molecular descriptors like molecular weight and number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. The target variable represents the biological activity of these molecules, ranging from highly active to inactive. The dataset was created for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict the biological activity of new molecules based on their molecular features. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for various applications in drug discovery and chemical research.
