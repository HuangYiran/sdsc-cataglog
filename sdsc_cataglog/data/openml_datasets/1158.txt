name: QSAR-TID-10842
dataset_id: 3134.0
description: QSAR-TID-10842 is a dataset consisting of 167 compounds with molecular descriptors and biological activities against a specific target. The dataset aims to investigate structure-activity relationships and identify potential drug candidates. The compounds were synthesized and tested by a research group, and the biological activities were measured through IC50 values. The molecular descriptors include physicochemical properties, topological indices, and quantum-chemical and electro-topological state indices. Each compound is represented by 1426 rows, and the dataset contains information on the chemical structure, compound name, and measured biological activity. QSAR-TID-10842 is valuable in drug discovery and can aid in predictive modeling for new drug development.
