name: Fashion-MNIST
dataset_id: 40996.0
description: Fashion-MNIST is a dataset comprised of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a testing set of 10,000 images. It serves as a replacement for the original MNIST dataset, providing a more challenging and relevant benchmark for machine learning algorithms. Each image is represented by a 28x28 pixel grid, showcasing various fashion categories such as T-shirts, dresses, trousers, and shoes. The dataset aims to aid in the development and evaluation of advanced algorithms for image classification tasks, offering researchers an opportunity to explore different approaches in the field.
