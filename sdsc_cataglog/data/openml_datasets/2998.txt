description: The dataset shapes refer to the dimensions (rows and columns) that a dataset possesses. In data analysis, it is important to understand the shape of a dataset as it provides valuable insights into the size and structure of the data. For instance, a dataset with a larger number of rows indicates a larger sample size, potentially leading to more statistical power and robust conclusions. Similarly, a dataset with more columns denotes a wider range of variables, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis. Recognizing the dataset shape aids in determining appropriate analytical techniques and understanding the complexity and richness of the dataset at hand.
