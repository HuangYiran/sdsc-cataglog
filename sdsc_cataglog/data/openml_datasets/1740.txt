name: QSAR-TID-10747
dataset_id: 3723.0
description: QSAR-TID-10747 is a dataset containing information about the biological activity of molecules. The dataset consists of 8,055 molecules, each with 315 molecular descriptors and a binary biological activity label. The descriptors include physicochemical properties, topological indices, and 2D and 3D autocorrelations. The biological activity label indicates whether a molecule is active or inactive against a specific target. This dataset was created for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and can be used to develop predictive models for drug discovery and chemical compound screening.
