name: hailfinder_0
dataset_id: 45175.0
description: The dataset hailfinder_0 is composed of multiple satellite images and weather attributes, specifically captured during hailstorms. Each satellite image depicts a specific weather event, and the dataset contains 10,000 images in total. These images were captured by different weather satellites and are labeled with corresponding metadata, such as the date and time of capture. Additionally, information about hail occurrences, size, and intensity are also provided. The dataset aims to facilitate research and development of computer vision algorithms to automatically detect and classify hailstorms, offering potential applications in early warning systems and insurance assessment.
