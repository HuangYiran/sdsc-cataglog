name: QSAR-TID-10003
dataset_id: 3835.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10003 contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) inputs and outputs for a set of piperidine derivatives. It includes 15 features that describe the chemical properties, such as molecular weight and topological indices. The target variable is the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in micromolar, which represents the compound's potency in inhibiting a specific receptor. The dataset consists of 226 samples, each with its respective IC50 value. The data is typically used for developing QSAR models to predict the potency of new piperidine derivatives and explore the relationships between the molecular features and the inhibitory activity.
