name: QSAR-TID-11169
dataset_id: 3266.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11169 dataset is a collection of molecular descriptors and biological activity values for a set of compounds. It consists of 11169 instances, where each instance represents a compound. The descriptors include attributes related to the structure and properties of the compounds, such as topological descriptors, constitutional descriptors, and molecular properties. The biological activity values represent the activity of the compounds against a specific target. This dataset is useful for building predictive models to determine the biological activity of new compounds based on their descriptors. It can be used to support drug discovery and development processes by screening potential compounds for their activity.
