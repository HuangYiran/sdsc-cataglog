name: QSAR-TID-11107
dataset_id: 3873.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11107 contains information on the antimicrobial activity of a set of molecules against the bacterium Escherichia coli. It consists of 104 molecular descriptors, including topological, physical-chemical, and quantum-chemical properties. The dataset also includes the antimicrobial activity expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in Î¼g/mL. The goal of this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the antimicrobial activity of new molecules accurately. The dataset can be utilized for machine learning and computational chemistry approaches to identify potential antimicrobial compounds and aid in the development of new antibiotics.
