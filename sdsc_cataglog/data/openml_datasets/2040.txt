name: QSAR-TID-17085
dataset_id: 4026.0
description: The QSAR-TID-17085 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds that have been tested for their ability to inhibit thrombin enzyme. The dataset consists of 17085 instances, with each instance representing a different compound and its associated chemical and biological properties. The compounds' structures are described by 307 numeric descriptors, which include measures of molecular size, shape, and atomic properties. The dataset also includes the biological activity of each compound, represented by an activity score that ranges from 0 to 10. This dataset can be useful for developing predictive models to determine the inhibitory activity of new compounds on the thrombin enzyme.
