name: mfeat-zernike
dataset_id: 995.0
description: The dataset mfeat-zernike consists of 2000 images, each sized at 128x128 pixels. It is derived from the original set of pen-based handwritten digit images, known as mfeat-dzer. These images were preprocessed to highlight specific features through Zernike moments. The Zernike moments are a set of orthogonal polynomials that provide a strong representation for shape description. The dataset contains a total of 47 features, which are given as floating-point numbers. Each feature captures different aspects of the shape of the digit, providing valuable information for pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms.
