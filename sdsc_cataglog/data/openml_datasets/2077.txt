name: QSAR-TID-245
dataset_id: 4063.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-245 contains information about molecules and their associated properties relevant to a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). The dataset consists of 1,055 entries and 9 input features, including molecular descriptors, topological indices, and constitutional numbers. The output variable is the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of chemicals, which represents their potency as inhibitors. The dataset has been used for predictive modeling and regression analysis tasks, particularly in developing QSAR models to assess and predict the bioactivity of chemical compounds. The QSAR-TID-245 dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and computational chemistry.
