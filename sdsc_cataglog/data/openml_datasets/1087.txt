name: QSAR-TID-226
dataset_id: 3063.0
description: QSAR-TID-226 is a dataset containing information about chemical compounds' potential to inhibit HIV-1 protease. The dataset includes 2252 compounds, each described by a set of 228 molecular descriptors. These descriptors quantify various molecular properties like shape, connectivity, and electronic arrangement. The compounds are classified into two categories: active (inhibiting HIV-1 protease) and inactive (not inhibiting). The dataset's purpose is to build a machine learning model that can predict a compound's activity level based on its molecular properties. The dataset is publicly available and can be utilized for QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) studies, drug discovery, and development of predictive models in medicinal chemistry.
