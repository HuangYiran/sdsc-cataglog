name: QSAR-TID-20126
dataset_id: 3290.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-20126 consists of molecular descriptors and their corresponding biological activity values for a set of compounds. The descriptors provide information such as the molecular weight, topological indices, and connectivity indices of each compound. The biological activity values represent the toxicity of each compound towards Tetrahymena pyriformis, which is a type of organism commonly used in toxicity testing. The dataset contains 2,012 instances and 531 attributes. The main objective is to develop predictive models that can accurately estimate the toxicity of unknown compounds using their molecular descriptors. This dataset is useful for researchers working in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling.
