description: The timing-attack-dataset-10-micro-seconds-delay-2022-09-09 dataset focuses on timing attacks with a 10 micro-seconds delay. It is set to be available on September 9, 2022. Timing attacks exploit variations in the execution time of certain operations to extract information. This dataset presumably contains examples that involve a delay of 10 microseconds. Timing attacks can be used to decipher sensitive information such as encryption keys or PIN numbers. The dataset aims to contribute to research and the development of countermeasures against timing attacks, potentially improving the security of systems and protocols vulnerable to such attacks.
