name: QSAR-TID-11843
dataset_id: 3767.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11843 consists of 3927 chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. These compounds were tested for their inhibitory effects on a specific enzyme. The dataset contains 6 features that describe the chemical and topological properties of the compounds. The target variable is the biological activity measurement, which is a continuous value ranging from 0 to 1. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of similar compounds on the enzyme. The dataset is available for public access and can be used in research related to drug discovery and chemical synthesis.
