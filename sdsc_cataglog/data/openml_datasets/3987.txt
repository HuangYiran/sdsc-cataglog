name: MagicTelescope
dataset_id: 44125.0
description: The MagicTelescope dataset comprises information on high-energy gamma-ray emissions from celestial objects captured by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope in La Palma, Spain. The dataset includes observations from two telescopes, MAGIC-I and MAGIC-II, covering the time period from 2004 to 2013. It encompasses features such as the event position, arrival time, signal shape, and other relevant characteristics of gamma-ray events. The dataset serves as a resource for analyzing and understanding high-energy gamma-ray sources and can be used for tasks like classification, regression, and anomaly detection in astrophysics research.
