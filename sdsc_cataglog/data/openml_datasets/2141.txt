name: QSAR-TID-30004
dataset_id: 4127.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30004 consists of 40 variables that describe various molecular properties and activities of 1055 chemical compounds. These compounds are classified into two classes: 0 and 1. Class 0 represents compounds that do not inhibit thrombin while class 1 represents compounds that do inhibit thrombin. The dataset provides information about the molecular structure, connectivity, and other physicochemical properties of the compounds, which can be used to predict their inhibitory activity against thrombin. This dataset is valuable for researchers in the field of drug discovery and development as it can assist in identifying potential thrombin inhibitors.
