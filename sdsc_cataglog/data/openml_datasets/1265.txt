name: QSAR-TID-101538
dataset_id: 3241.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101538 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds used for drug discovery purposes. It contains 824 chemical structures and their corresponding molecular activities against a target protein. The dataset includes various attributes such as molecular descriptors, physicochemical properties, and biological activities. The goal is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new compounds against the target protein based on their structural characteristics. This dataset can be valuable for researchers working in the field of computational drug design and development.
