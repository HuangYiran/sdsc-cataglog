name: a5a
dataset_id: 1426.0
description: The dataset a5a is a binary classification problem dataset containing 1,243 instances and 123 features. It is a sparse dataset, with an average of 11.7 non-zero features per instance. The dataset is organized in a sparse matrix format using the LibSVM file format, where each line represents an instance and the first value in each line is the target class (either -1 or +1). The target class comprises approximately 1/3 of the instances, making it an imbalanced dataset. The a5a dataset has been widely used in machine learning research, particularly for studying classification algorithms and techniques for imbalanced datasets.
