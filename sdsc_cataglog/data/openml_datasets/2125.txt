name: QSAR-TID-76
dataset_id: 4111.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-76 consists of 776 compounds with their biological activities against the Thrombin Inhibitory activity. It includes a total of 181 descriptors encompassing various properties like constitutional, geometrical, electronic, and thermodynamic. The dataset also provides information on the presence of substituents like chlorine, fluorine, and iodine atoms in the compounds. The dataset aims to predict and understand the relationship between these molecular descriptors and the biological activity against Thrombin Inhibitory activity, which can help in the development of new drugs targeting thrombin inhibition. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for QSAR modeling and other related research purposes.
