name: QSAR-TID-10235
dataset_id: 3777.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10235 dataset focuses on biological activity prediction for potential inhibitors of the enzyme aldose reductase, crucial in diabetic complications. It consists of 358 compounds, with each marked as active, moderately active, or inactive. The dataset includes 132 molecular descriptors related to the compounds, such as structural and physicochemical properties. The aim is to develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to distinguish the compounds' activity levels accurately. The dataset can aid researchers in understanding the molecular factors and patterns influencing the inhibitory activity of aldose reductase inhibitors, potentially leading to the development of novel and effective drugs for diabetic complications.
