name: QSAR-TID-11498
dataset_id: 3553.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11498 contains information on various chemical compounds. It consists of 980 instances and 529 numerical attributes. The compounds are classified into two classes - active and inactive. The aim of this dataset is to predict the activity of the compounds using their structural features. The data is highly imbalanced, with most compounds being inactive. Therefore, appropriate techniques need to be applied to handle this imbalance. The dataset is provided in CSV format and can be used for classification tasks in the field of chemoinformatics.
