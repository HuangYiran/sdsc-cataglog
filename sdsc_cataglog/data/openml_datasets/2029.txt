name: QSAR-TID-11575
dataset_id: 4015.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11575 dataset consists of 74 chemical compounds, used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. The compounds belong to various chemical classes and were tested for their ability to inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. The dataset includes 1D and 2D molecular descriptors, along with the experimentally measured biological activity for each compound. The goal of this dataset is to develop a model that can accurately predict the activity of new compounds towards NMDA receptor inhibition. It can be used by researchers in the field of drug design and discovery to investigate potential compounds for therapeutic purposes.
