name: QSAR-TID-103584
dataset_id: 3890.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103584 is a collection of molecular descriptors and biological activities of a set of compounds. It contains 1036 instances and 31 attributes, which include various physicochemical properties and structural features of the compounds. The dataset was created to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxic effects of the compounds on Tetrahymena pyriformis. The toxicity values were measured using the endpoint protocol. The dataset has been used in several research studies to build predictive models and investigate the relationship between molecular features and toxicity. It provides valuable insights for toxicologists and researchers working in the field of computational toxicology.
