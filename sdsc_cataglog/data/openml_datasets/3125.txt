name: electrical-grid-stability
dataset_id: 43007.0
description: The dataset electrical-grid-stability consists of 10,000 instances with 5 input variables and a target variable indicating grid stability. The input variables include the local/global stability, voltage stability, angular stability, transient stability, and state. The target variable is binary, with 0 indicating unstable grid and 1 indicating stable grid. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with 68% instances belonging to the stable class. This dataset can be utilized for binary classification tasks in predicting grid stability. However, due to the imbalanced nature, appropriate techniques such as oversampling or undersampling should be employed to balance the classes and ensure accurate model training and evaluation.
