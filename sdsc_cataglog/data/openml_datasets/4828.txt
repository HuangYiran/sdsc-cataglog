name: hepar2_0
dataset_id: 45186.0
description: Hepar2_0 is a dataset that contains information about hepatic gene expression in various mouse models of liver disease. The data includes gene expression levels of over 20,000 genes, both in healthy and diseased liver tissues. The dataset also includes information about the experimental conditions, such as the age and sex of the mice, as well as the specific liver disease model that was used. The hepar2_0 dataset is useful for researchers studying liver disease, as it allows them to compare gene expression patterns between different disease models and identify potential therapeutic targets.
