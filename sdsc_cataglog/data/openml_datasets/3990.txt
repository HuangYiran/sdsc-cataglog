name: MiniBooNE
dataset_id: 44128.0
description: The MiniBooNE dataset is derived from an experiment conducted at Fermilab to explore the oscillations of neutrinos. It consists of data collected from a detector called MiniBooNE over a period of six years. The dataset contains information about the interaction of neutrinos with the detector, such as their energies and angles. The experiment aimed to determine if there is evidence of oscillations happening in neutrinos and to study their properties. The MiniBooNE dataset has been used by researchers to analyze and understand the behavior of neutrinos, contributing valuable insights to the field of particle physics.
