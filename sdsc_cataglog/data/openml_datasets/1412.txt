name: QSAR-TID-100918
dataset_id: 3392.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100918 contains information about 105 different organic chemicals and their biological activity. It includes 828 molecular descriptors that were calculated based on their structural and electronic properties. The dataset also provides the binary classification of each compound as either active or inactive. The compounds were tested for their potential as inhibitors of thrombin, an enzyme involved in blood clots. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between the molecular properties, as represented by the descriptors, and the biological activity. This information can be used to build predictive models or gain insights into the structure-activity relationship of these compounds.
