name: QSAR-TID-102669
dataset_id: 3943.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102669 consists of information related to 1055 chemical compounds used in the development of drugs. It includes the biological activity against the target protein TID (6-((4-((2-(2-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)acetamido)benzoyl)amino)phenyl)amino)hexanoic acid) along with various molecular descriptors. The molecular descriptors cover a wide range of properties such as topological, geometrical, and electronic features. The dataset is valuable for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds. Such models can aid in the design of novel drugs with specific target interactions and potentially save time and resources in the drug development process.
