name: QSAR-TID-11530
dataset_id: 3804.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11530 is a collection of various chemical compounds and their corresponding activities against a specific target. It consists of 11530 examples, with each example having 374 features. The dataset also provides additional information such as the compound ID, the source from which it was obtained, and the experimental activity values. The target activity values are given as continuous numbers ranging from 0 to 1. The dataset aims to be used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, where the objective is to predict the activity of new compounds based on their structural features.
