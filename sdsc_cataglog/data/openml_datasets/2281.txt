name: CIFAR_10
dataset_id: 40927.0
description: The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 images divided into 10 classes. Each image is of 32x32 pixels and belongs to one of the classes like airplane, automobile, bird, etc. It is widely used in the field of computer vision for image recognition and classification tasks. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is a challenging dataset due to its low resolution and object diversity. CIFAR-10 has been extensively used for benchmarking different algorithms and models in the field of deep learning and pattern recognition.
