name: QSAR-TID-266
dataset_id: 3187.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-266 contains information about the biological activity of a set of compounds against the liver fluke parasite. There are a total of 266 compounds in the dataset, each represented by 166 molecular descriptors. The biological activity of these compounds is measured using the logarithm of the inhibition concentration (IC50). The dataset also includes information about the compounds' effectiveness against two different strains of the parasite. The QSAR-TID-266 dataset can be used for developing predictive models to determine the potential effectiveness of new compounds against the liver fluke parasite.
