description: The ChronicKidneyDisease dataset contains medical information on patients with kidney disease. The dataset includes 24 attributes, including patient age, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and various urine parameters. The goal of the dataset is to predict whether a patient has chronic kidney disease or not. There are 400 instances in the dataset, with 250 instances diagnosed with the disease and 150 instances without it. Pre-processing of the dataset involved handling missing values and converting categorical attributes into numeric form. The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks to develop models that can predict the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease based on given patient characteristics.
