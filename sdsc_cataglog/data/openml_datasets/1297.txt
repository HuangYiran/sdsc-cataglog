name: QSAR-TID-102401
dataset_id: 3273.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102401 consists of information related to the toxicity of various substances. It includes a total of 798 compounds, with each compound having 41 molecular descriptors. The descriptors provide details about the structure and properties of the compounds, such as the presence of certain chemical groups and the number of atoms. The toxicity of the compounds is measured using IC50 values, which represent the concentration required to inhibit the growth of a specific organism by 50%. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of models that can predict the toxicity of compounds based on their molecular descriptors, enabling efficient screening of potentially harmful substances.
