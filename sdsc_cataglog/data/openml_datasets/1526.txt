name: QSAR-TID-12910
dataset_id: 3510.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12910 dataset is a collection of 2D molecular descriptors and measured toxic values for 7,742 different compounds. It was created for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of chemicals. The descriptors represent various properties of the molecules, such as size, shape, and chemical bonding characteristics. The toxic values were obtained from experimental testing, and they represent the level of toxicity for each compound. This dataset can be utilized to train machine learning algorithms and build models that can accurately predict the toxicity of chemicals based on their structural properties.
