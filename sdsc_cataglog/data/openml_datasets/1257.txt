name: QSAR-TID-30038
dataset_id: 3233.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30038 is related to the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) for the prediction of acute aquatic toxicity in fish. The dataset consists of 740 different chemicals and their corresponding toxicity values measured as LC50. The chemicals encompass a wide range of organic compounds with diverse structural characteristics. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors that capture different aspects of the chemical structure. These descriptors include information regarding the presence of functional groups, atomic properties, and topological indices. The dataset is commonly used for developing computational models to predict the toxicity of new chemicals, aiding in the assessment of potential risks to aquatic ecosystems.
