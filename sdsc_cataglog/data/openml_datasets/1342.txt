name: QSAR-TID-20109
dataset_id: 3319.0
description: The QSAR-TID-20109 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds with biological activities. It contains information about 2,012 different compounds and their respective activities against a specific target protein. The dataset provides various features or descriptors for each compound, including molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and lipophilicity. Additional information about the compounds, such as their names and structures, is also available. This dataset is useful for studying quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and can be used for developing models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds.
