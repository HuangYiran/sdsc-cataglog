name: QSAR-TID-11606
dataset_id: 3641.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11606 consists of 7,352 different molecules. Each molecule is represented by a set of 2D and 3D descriptors, which describe its structural and chemical properties. There are a total of 588 descriptors for each molecule. The dataset includes information about the mutagenic behavior of the molecules, with values ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates non-mutagenic behavior, while a value of 1 represents mutagenic behavior. The dataset is commonly used for the development of predictive models to determine the mutagenic potential of new molecules.
