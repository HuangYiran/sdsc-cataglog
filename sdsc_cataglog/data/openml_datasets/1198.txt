name: QSAR-TID-100163
dataset_id: 3174.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100163 contains information about chemical compounds and their biological activity. It consists of 144 chemical compounds, represented by 1024 molecular descriptors, which were calculated using quantum chemical calculations. The dataset also includes the biological activity of these compounds, measured as an IC50 value, which represents the concentration of a compound required to inhibit a certain biological process. The aim of this dataset is to develop a predictive model to estimate the biological activity of new chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. This dataset can be useful in drug discovery and design processes.
