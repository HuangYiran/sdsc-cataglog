name: QSAR-TID-101584
dataset_id: 3173.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101584 dataset is a collection of compounds used in the prediction of aquatic toxicity. It contains information about the molecular structures of various compounds along with their corresponding aquatic toxicity values. The dataset consists of 346 instances, each with 41 attributes. These attributes include structural and property-based descriptors such as lipophilicity, molecular weight, and topological indices. The goal of utilizing this dataset is to develop predictive models that can accurately determine the aquatic toxicity of compounds based on these descriptors. The dataset is valuable for researchers in the field of chemistry and environmental science studying the effects of chemicals on aquatic ecosystems.
