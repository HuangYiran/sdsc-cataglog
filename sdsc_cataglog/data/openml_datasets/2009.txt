dataset_id: 3995.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101073 contains information about the anti-HIV activity of a set of compounds. It consists of 414 compounds, with each compound being described by 10 molecular descriptors and the experimentally measured activity value. The goal of this dataset is to create a predictive model that can accurately predict the anti-HIV activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset is widely used in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies and machine learning approaches to drug design and discovery.
