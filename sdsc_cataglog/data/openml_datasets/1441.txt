name: QSAR-TID-11722
dataset_id: 3421.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11722 is a collection of compounds and their corresponding biological activity values. It consists of 6,692 compounds and 5 numeric attributes. The compounds were tested for their activity against a specific target. The activity values range from 0 to 9, indicating the degree of biological activity. The dataset also includes information about the compound's molecular structure. The purpose of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their structural features. The dataset is freely available for research purposes.
