name: QSAR-TID-11896
dataset_id: 4110.0
description: QSAR-TID-11896 is a dataset containing molecular descriptors and bioactivity data for a set of compounds. The dataset consists of 4,486 instances with 828 descriptors, including atom-centered fragments, charge descriptors, and other physicochemical properties. There are three classes of compounds based on their bioactivity - active, intermediate, and inactive. The dataset is intended for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the bioactivity of compounds. The dataset is publicly available and has been used in various studies to evaluate the performance of different QSAR modeling techniques. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the field of cheminformatics and drug discovery.
