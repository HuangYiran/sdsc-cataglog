name: QSAR-TID-101508
dataset_id: 3080.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101508 dataset is a collection of data representing the activity of various compounds against a specific target. It includes information about the chemical structure of the compounds, as well as their biological activity. The dataset contains 336 compounds, classified into four activity classes. Each compound is described by 100 molecular descriptors, which provide numerical information about its chemical properties. This dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the activity of new compounds against the same target based on their molecular descriptors.
