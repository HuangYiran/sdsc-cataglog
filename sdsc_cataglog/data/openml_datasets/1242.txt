name: QSAR-TID-30021
dataset_id: 3218.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30021 includes information about a series of chemical compounds and their biological activities. It consists of 369 compounds and 1024 molecular descriptors. The descriptors are calculated based on the compounds' molecular structure, and they provide information about their chemical and physical properties. The dataset also includes the biological activity of the compounds, which measures their effectiveness in inhibiting thrombin, an enzyme involved in blood clotting. This dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds, aiding in drug discovery and development processes.
