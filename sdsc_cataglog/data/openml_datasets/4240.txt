name: Higgs_seed_1_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True
dataset_id: 44418.0
description: The dataset Higgs_seed_1_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True is about Higgs boson, a subatomic particle. It consists of 2000 rows and 100 columns, with 10 different classes. The dataset has been created using a stratified sampling technique, which ensures that each class is represented proportionally in the dataset. The dataset most probably contains information about the properties and characteristics of Higgs boson, and its purpose may be to analyze and classify different types of Higgs boson particles based on the given features. Such a dataset can be useful for research and scientific analysis in the field of particle physics.
