name: QSAR-TID-11261
dataset_id: 4077.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11261 is used for predicting the logarithm of the toxicological endpoint LD50 in rats. It consists of 1416 compounds with 43 molecular descriptors, including structural, electrostatic, and energy-related properties. The dataset provides information about the toxicity levels of different chemical compounds, which is measured by the LD50 metric. This dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to understand the relationship between chemical properties and toxicity levels. Researchers can use this dataset to explore various machine learning techniques and algorithms for predicting the toxicity of new compounds, leading to more efficient and safer drug design and development processes.
