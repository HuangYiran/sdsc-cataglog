name: QSAR-TID-10530
dataset_id: 3100.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10530 contains information about the biological activity of various compounds. It includes 74 instances, each with 41 molecular descriptors and a class label indicating the compound's activity. The data is divided into 53 training instances and 21 test instances. The class label has two possible values: active or inactive. The dataset was originally created for regression tasks, but it can also be used for classification tasks by converting the activity values into binary labels. The goal with this dataset is to develop models that can accurately predict the activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
