name: QSAR-TID-30012
dataset_id: 3904.0
description: The QSAR-TID-30012 dataset contains 3015 chemical compounds classified as either active or inactive for a biological target. It includes 1623 active compounds and 1392 inactive compounds. The dataset also provides 14 molecular descriptors, such as the number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, which are used to quantify the chemical properties of each compound. These descriptors are designed to capture the structural and chemical composition of the compounds, helping in predicting their biological activity. The dataset aims to support the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the activity of new compounds based on their molecular attributes.
