name: QSAR-TID-11752
dataset_id: 3713.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11752 dataset comprises 7,515 chemical compounds, each characterized by 1,569 molecular descriptors. These compounds were obtained from a public database and represent a diverse range of chemical classes. The goal of this dataset is to predict the anti-HIV activity of these compounds based on their molecular structure. The dataset contains both positive and negative instances, indicating whether a compound exhibits antiviral activity or not. The molecular descriptors include various properties such as atom-based, topological, physicochemical, and electronic features. This dataset can be valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship models and exploring the relationship between molecular features and antiviral activity.
