name: QSAR-TID-17000
dataset_id: 3952.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17000 is a collection of chemical compounds with associated toxicological properties. It contains information on 17,000 compounds, each represented by a set of molecular descriptors. These descriptors include various characteristics such as size, shape, and chemical composition of the compounds. The dataset aims to assist in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the toxicological properties of new compounds based on their structural characteristics. The dataset is publicly available and has been widely used by researchers in the field of drug discovery and toxicology.
