name: QSAR-TID-100410
dataset_id: 4100.0
description: The QSAR-TID-100410 dataset is composed of 800 compounds with 41 molecular descriptors that were used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. It aims to predict the toxicity of compounds towards Tetrahymena pyriformis, a small aquatic organism widely used in eco-toxicity studies. The dataset includes both binary toxic (positive) and non-toxic (negative) compounds, allowing for classification analysis. The molecular descriptors represent various properties of the compounds, such as the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, logP, and molecular weight. Researchers can apply this dataset to develop models for predicting the ecotoxicity of chemicals and aid in the evaluation of potential hazards.
