description: The dataset "gascons" contains information about methane emissions from the Gascon cattle breed. It includes measurements of methane production rate, dry matter intake, and diet quality for individual cows. The data was gathered through a study that aimed to understand how different factors impact methane emissions in the breed. The dataset also includes additional information such as the age of the cows and the location where the measurements were taken. This dataset can be valuable for researchers and scientists studying methane emissions and looking to develop strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the livestock industry.
