name: QSAR-TID-10478
dataset_id: 3091.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10478 dataset comprises structural and toxicity data of 7,950 compounds. The compounds are classified into two classes: active and inactive, based on their biological activity against a specific protein target. The data features include 114 molecular descriptors representing the structural properties of the compounds. The dataset also provides the binary class labels for each compound indicating their activity. It is utilized for developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms to predict the activity of new compounds against the protein target. The dataset has been made available to facilitate research and development in drug discovery and design.
