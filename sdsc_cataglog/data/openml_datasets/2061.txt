name: QSAR-TID-101225
dataset_id: 4047.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101225 dataset is a collection of 41 molecular descriptors for 1055 organic compounds. These descriptors include information about the molecular structure, hydrophobicity, electronic properties, and other factors. The dataset also provides the measured activity of each compound against a particular biological target. The target is not specified, and the activity is given as a continuous variable. The dataset aims to enable the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship models for predicting the effectiveness of compounds against the target. However, no specific details about the compounds or target are disclosed in the dataset description.
