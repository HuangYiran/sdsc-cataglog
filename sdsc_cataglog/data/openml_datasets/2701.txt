dataset_id: 42056.0
description: The iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning. It consists of 150 instances of iris flowers, each with measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each instance into one of three iris species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The dataset is balanced, with 50 instances of each species. It is commonly used for classification tasks, allowing researchers to test algorithms and models. The iris dataset is popular due to its simplicity and accessibility, making it a good starting point for beginners in machine learning.
