name: QSAR-TID-10378
dataset_id: 3075.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10378 dataset contains information about the inhibition constant (logKi) for a set of compounds. It consists of 60 molecules, each represented by 209 molecular descriptors. The dataset also includes the class label of each compound, indicating its level of inhibitory activity (active or inactive). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the logKi values based on the molecular descriptors. The dataset is useful for studying the structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and can be used in the development of new drug molecules with desired inhibitory activity.
