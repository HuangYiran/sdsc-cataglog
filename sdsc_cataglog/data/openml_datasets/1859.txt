name: QSAR-TID-12347
dataset_id: 3844.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12347 provides information about the biological activity of various compounds. It consists of 1513 instances, each having 574 attributes. The dataset aims to predict the potential toxicity of the compounds using a regression model. The attributes represent the molecular descriptors of the compounds, including features like hydrophobicity, polarizability, and electronic properties. The target variable is a continuous value indicating the toxicity level. The dataset is suitable for developing machine learning models to understand the relationship between the molecular features and toxicity, and to eventually predict the toxicity of new compounds.
