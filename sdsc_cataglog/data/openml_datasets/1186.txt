name: QSAR-TID-11785
dataset_id: 3162.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11785 is a collection of chemical compounds, each represented by multiple molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide information about the structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds. The dataset contains 11,785 instances and 102 descriptors in total. It is commonly used in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, where the goal is to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their molecular properties. The dataset is publicly available and has been used in various studies to develop and evaluate prediction models for bioactivity.
