description: The dataset, analcatdata_challenger, is a collection of data related to the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster in 1986. The dataset contains information about the temperature, erosion, O-ring damage, and launch conditions of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters. It consists of 23 observations and 26 variables, including binary variables indicating whether the O-rings were damaged or not. The dataset is commonly used to analyze the relationship between temperature and O-ring damage, as it is believed that cold temperatures played a significant role in the disaster. This dataset provides valuable insights into risk assessment and decision-making in engineering and space exploration.
