name: QSAR-TID-12718
dataset_id: 3383.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12718 dataset contains information about different compounds and their corresponding bioactivity values against a specific target. It includes 405 compounds and 897 computed molecular descriptors. The dataset was created for the purpose of developing predictive models for the bioactivity of compounds. Each compound is represented by its molecular structure and various physicochemical properties. The bioactivity values were experimentally measured and represent the affinity of the compound towards the target. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the field of drug discovery and computational chemistry to study and predict the bioactivity of compounds based on their molecular features.
