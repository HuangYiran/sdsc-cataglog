name: Lymphoma-11
dataset_id: 45096.0
description: The dataset Lymphoma-11 contains gene expression profiles of 402 patients diagnosed with 11 subtypes of lymphoma. It includes data from three platforms: cDNA microarray, Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array, and Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. The objective of this dataset is to identify which genes are differentially expressed across different subtypes of lymphoma. The dataset provides information on clinical features such as survival status, gender, and age at diagnosis for each patient. The availability of gene expression data and clinical information makes the Lymphoma-11 dataset valuable for studying the underlying molecular mechanisms and developing diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for lymphoma subtypes.
