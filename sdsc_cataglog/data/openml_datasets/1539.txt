name: QSAR-TID-100425
dataset_id: 3523.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100425 is a collection of data that consists of different physicochemical properties and the biological activity of 662 compounds. The compounds are categorized into either active or inactive based on their ability to inhibit the thrombin enzyme. The dataset includes 10 molecular descriptors that provide information on the compounds' structural and chemical properties. These descriptors include molecular weight, solubility, and polar surface area. The dataset has been used to train and test machine learning models to predict the biological activity of similar compounds. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for further research in drug discovery and development.
