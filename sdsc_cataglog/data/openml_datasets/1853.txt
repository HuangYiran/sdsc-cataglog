name: QSAR-TID-10216
dataset_id: 3838.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10216 dataset is a compilation of chemical structures and their corresponding biological activities. It contains information on 2,016 chemical compounds, where each compound is represented by 1,020 molecular descriptors. These descriptors are numerical values that quantify various properties and characteristics of the compounds. The dataset is primarily focused on predicting the toxicological activities of the chemicals, and it includes binary classification labels indicating whether a compound is active or inactive. The data can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict the activity of unknown chemical entities based on their structural features.
