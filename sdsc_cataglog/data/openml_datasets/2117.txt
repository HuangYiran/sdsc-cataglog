name: QSAR-TID-100948
dataset_id: 4103.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100948 consists of 200 molecules with 41 molecular descriptors. This dataset aims to provide quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for the toxicity of drugs. The dataset includes several types of chemicals with potential drug-like activity. The molecular descriptors in this dataset represent various physicochemical properties of the molecules, such as their size, shape, polarity, and electronic properties. The toxicity values for each molecule are also provided, indicating their toxicological effects. QSAR analysis using this dataset can help in developing predictive models to evaluate the potential toxicity of drugs, aiding in drug discovery and development processes.
