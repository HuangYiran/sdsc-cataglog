name: QSAR-TID-103441
dataset_id: 3431.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103441 contains information regarding the potential toxicity of various molecules. It includes 74 attributes, such as molecular descriptors and chemical properties, to predict the toxicity class of each molecule. The data encompasses 1055 molecules, which are classified into four toxicity classes based on their LD50 values. The LD50 values represent the lethal dose required to cause the death of 50% of a tested population. This dataset is significant in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to assess the toxicity of molecules and aid in drug discovery and chemical risk assessment.
