name: AP_Colon_Prostate
dataset_id: 1135.0
description: The dataset AP_Colon_Prostate comprises digital images of biopsies obtained from tissues of the colon and prostate. It was created to aid in training computer systems in identifying and classifying these tissues accurately. The dataset contains both individual frames and video sequences, capturing different areas within each organ. Annotations are available, providing labels for different tissue structures, including cancerous and non-cancerous regions. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on AI-based systems for cancer diagnosis and classification. It enables the development of machine learning algorithms that can assist in early detection and precise characterization of colon and prostate cancers.
