dataset_id: 41996.0
description: The iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples, each representing an iris flower from one of three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The samples are described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is often used for classification tasks, as the goal is to accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its features. It is a well-known dataset that has been extensively studied and used in various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
