name: QSAR-TID-13067
dataset_id: 3560.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-13067 consists of 4,466 chemical compounds, each represented by 8,064 molecular descriptors. These descriptors capture various physical, topological, and quantum-chemical features of the compounds. The dataset categorizes the compounds into two classes based on their ability to inhibit thrombin, a protein involved in blood clotting. Class 1 contains compounds with inhibitory activity, while Class 2 contains compounds without inhibitory activity. The dataset aims to provide a resource for predicting and understanding the relationship between molecular features and thrombin inhibition, which could aid in the design and development of new anticoagulant drugs.
