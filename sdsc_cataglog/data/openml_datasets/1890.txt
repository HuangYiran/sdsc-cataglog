name: QSAR-TID-188
dataset_id: 3875.0
description: The QSAR-TID-188 dataset consists of 1054 compounds used for predicting the skin permeability coefficient. The dataset contains various molecular descriptors, including topological and electronic properties, as well as physicochemical and constitutional descriptors. Some features were computed using chemoinformatics software, while others were derived using empirical formulas. The target variable, skin permeability coefficient, was obtained through experimental measurements. The dataset was curated to exclude outliers and maintain consistency. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing models to predict skin permeability and understanding the factors influencing it in the context of drug discovery and development.
