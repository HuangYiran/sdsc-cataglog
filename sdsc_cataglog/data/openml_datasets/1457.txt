name: QSAR-TID-102981
dataset_id: 3437.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102981 contains 740 molecules with their associated activity values against a specific target protein. It comprises 41 molecular descriptors, including topological and physicochemical properties, which are numerical representations of the molecules. The activity values are given as continuous variables ranging from -9.0 to 1.6, with higher values indicating higher activity. The dataset aims to predict the activity of new molecules based on their descriptors using regression techniques. Several molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight and number of hydrogen bond donors, could potentially be useful in predicting the target protein activity.
