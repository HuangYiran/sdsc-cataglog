name: Diabetes(scikit-learn)
dataset_id: 41516.0
description: The Diabetes dataset in scikit-learn is a widely used collection of clinical measurements related to diabetes. It consists of ten baseline variables, including age, BMI, blood pressure, and blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. The dataset provides an opportunity to explore correlations between these variables and the progression of diabetes. It has been used extensively in machine learning research to develop predictive models and evaluate their performance. The dataset is commonly used for regression tasks and provides a valuable resource for studying diabetes and developing efficient healthcare solutions.
