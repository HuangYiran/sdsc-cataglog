name: mfeat-karhunen
dataset_id: 16.0
description: The dataset mfeat-karhunen is a collection of 10 classifications of 2000 2D hand-drawn characters. The characters are normalized within a box of 30x32 pixels. Each class includes 200 examples. The dataset contains raw data as well as a preprocessed version with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The primary purpose of this dataset is to demonstrate the use of the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) in analyzing images. This dataset can be used for tasks like image classification, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. It provides a valuable resource for exploring the application of KLT and evaluating image recognition algorithms.
