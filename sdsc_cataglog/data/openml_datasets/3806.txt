name: airfoil_self_noise
dataset_id: 43919.0
description: The dataset "airfoil_self_noise" contains data on the noise levels emitted from airfoils (wing-like structures) used in aircraft design. It consists of 1,503 samples of varying airfoil configurations, measured in a wind tunnel, at different angles of attack and at a range of wind speeds. The dataset includes six continuous attributes such as frequency, angle of attack, chord length, free-stream velocity, suction side displacement thickness, and scaled sound pressure level. The goal of the dataset is to predict the scaled sound pressure level based on these input parameters. It is frequently used for regression analysis and machine learning tasks.
