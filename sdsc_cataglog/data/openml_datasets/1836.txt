name: QSAR-TID-100856
dataset_id: 3821.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100856 contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data for a set of chemical compounds. It comprises various features and their corresponding activity values, which are indicator variables expressing the activity or inactivity of chemical compounds against a specific target. The dataset aims to assist in the development of predictive models for identifying potentially active compounds. The features in the dataset include molecular descriptors, topological indices, and atom-based properties. The activity values are represented by IC50 values, which indicate the concentration necessary to inhibit a specific biological activity by 50%. The dataset is valuable for researchers in drug discovery and computational chemistry.
