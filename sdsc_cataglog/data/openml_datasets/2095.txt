name: QSAR-TID-100949
dataset_id: 4081.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100949 is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activity. It consists of 1,349 molecules and 1024 molecular descriptors. The descriptors represent various characteristics of the molecules, such as their size, shape, and chemical properties. The biological activity of each compound is measured using a quantitative measure called the IC50 value, which represents the concentration required to inhibit biological activity by 50%. The dataset is derived from a study on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation, which is an important process in toxicology and drug discovery. The dataset can be used for developing predictive models to assess the potential toxicity or biological activity of similar chemical compounds.
