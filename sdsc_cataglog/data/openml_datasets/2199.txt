name: thyroid-allhypo
dataset_id: 40476.0
description: The thyroid-allhypo dataset contains information about patients with hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. It consists of 2800 instances with 25 attributes, including patient attributes like age and sex, as well as thyroid function test results. The dataset is commonly used for diagnosing thyroid disease and includes several missing values. The goal of using this dataset is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify patients as either having hypothyroidism or being euthyroid (having a normally functioning thyroid gland) based on the given attributes.
