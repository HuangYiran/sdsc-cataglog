name: QSAR-TID-103469
dataset_id: 3876.0
description: The QSAR-TID-103469 dataset contains information on the relationships between the chemical structure and the biological activity of compounds. It consists of 374 chemical compounds with 27 molecular descriptors and their corresponding biological activities. The descriptors include properties such as molecular weight, polarizability, and topological indices. The biological activities are measured as the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against the target. The dataset aims to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and to predict the biological activity of unknown compounds based on their chemical structure by employing machine learning algorithms.
