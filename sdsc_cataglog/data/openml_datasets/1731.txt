name: QSAR-TID-11119
dataset_id: 3714.0
description: The QSAR-TID-11119 dataset is related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for the prediction of toxicity. It consists of 7,205 compounds and their corresponding toxicity values. The compounds belong to various chemical classes and exhibit a wide range of toxicities. 2D and 3D molecular descriptors, as well as quantum chemical descriptors, have been computed for each compound. These descriptors provide information about the structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds. The dataset can be used for developing predictive models to assess the toxicity of new chemical compounds and to aid in the prediction of potential hazards.
