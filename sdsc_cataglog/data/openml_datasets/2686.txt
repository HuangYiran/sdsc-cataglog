dataset_id: 42020.0
description: The iris dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It consists of measurements of four features of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. There are a total of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each species. This dataset is often used for classification tasks, as the goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements. It has become a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating various algorithms and models in the field of machine learning.
