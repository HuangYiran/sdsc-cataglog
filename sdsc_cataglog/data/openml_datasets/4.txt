dataset_id: 6.0
description: The dataset named "letter" consists of 20,000 instances with 16 attributes. Each instance represents a letter of the English alphabet. The dataset was generated using 20 different hand-drawn fonts, resulting in variations in the shape of each letter. The attributes provide information about the shape of the letter, such as the position of its center, horizontal and vertical symmetry, and so on. The goal of using this dataset is to classify each letter correctly based on its shape attributes. This dataset has been widely used in machine learning research for tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, and feature selection.
