name: QSAR-TID-11379
dataset_id: 4051.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11379 contains information related to the Quality Standard Assay Results (QSAR) of 72 chemical compounds. Each compound is represented by 3 descriptors, including the molecular weight, the octanol-water partition coefficient, and the number of atoms. The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the biological activity of these compounds, specifically whether they inhibit or activate a bio-target. This information is crucial for drug discovery and development processes, allowing scientists to identify potential compounds for further investigation. The dataset provides a valuable resource for developing predictive models and understanding the relationship between chemical properties and bio-activity.
