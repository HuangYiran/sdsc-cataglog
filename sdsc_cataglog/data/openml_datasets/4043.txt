description: The dataset "Intersectional-Bias-Assessment-(Testing-Data)" contains information about the assessment of bias in machine learning models. It consists of 10,000 sentences, each labeled with an intersectional bias score, assessing biases related to gender, race, and religion. The scoring was done by human annotators based on their perception of bias in the sentences. The dataset aims to evaluate the effectiveness of models in identifying bias and improving the fairness of machine learning algorithms when it comes to intersectional biases. It serves as valuable testing data to develop unbiased AI models and address bias-related issues in machine learning systems.
