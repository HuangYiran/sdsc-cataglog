name: QSAR-TID-10056
dataset_id: 3413.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10056 contains information on the toxicity of various compounds. It consists of 85 instances or samples, with each sample having 14 different features. The target variable in this dataset represents the toxicity of the compounds, which is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate higher toxicity. The features include both numerical and categorical variables, such as molecular weight, solubility, and chemical descriptors. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between these features and the toxicity of the compounds, allowing researchers to develop models and predictive methods for assessing toxicity.
