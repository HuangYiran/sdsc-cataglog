name: QSAR-TID-100424
dataset_id: 3479.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100424 contains information on the biological activity of molecules for drug discovery. It includes 930 instances with 47 independent variables, consisting of molecular descriptors calculated for molecules. The dependent variable represents the activity of molecules against a specific target protein. The dataset is used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the activity of new molecules. The dataset is created for research purposes in the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery. It can guide the development of new drugs by identifying molecular features associated with the desired biological activity and provide insights for experimental design.
