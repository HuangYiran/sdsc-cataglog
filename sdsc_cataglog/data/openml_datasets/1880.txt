name: QSAR-TID-100287
dataset_id: 3865.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100287 contains information about the biological activity of several compounds. It includes 54 instances, each having 41 attributes. The dataset focuses on predicting the toxicological information of compounds, such as their LD50 values, which represent the lethal dose for 50% of the tested population. The attribute values were calculated using various molecular descriptors, including atomic and functional group properties. The dataset aims to assist in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting toxicological properties of new compounds. The data is provided in a tabular format and can be used for machine learning and data analysis tasks.
