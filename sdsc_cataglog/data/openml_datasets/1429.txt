name: QSAR-TID-17134
dataset_id: 3409.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17134 consists of 720 molecules with their corresponding Molecular Descriptors (MDs) and Oral Toxicity for rats. The goal is to develop a QSAR classification model to predict the toxicity of a molecule based on its MDs. MDs are numerical values that represent various properties of a molecule. The dataset also includes several columns with MDs derived from the 3D atomic Cartesian coordinates resulting in a total of 41 columns. The data is split into training and test sets for model development and evaluation. The dataset provides an opportunity to explore and develop predictive models for oral toxicity prediction.
