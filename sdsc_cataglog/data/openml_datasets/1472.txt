name: QSAR-TID-12744
dataset_id: 3454.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12744 is related to the prediction of acute aquatic toxicity of diverse compounds on the water flea, Daphnia magna. It includes 91 compounds and 8 molecular descriptors. The compounds were tested in a laboratory setting to determine their impact on the survival rate of Daphnia magna after 48 hours of exposure. The molecular descriptors provide information about the structural characteristics of the compounds. The dataset aims to help in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of similar compounds. It is freely available for research purposes.
