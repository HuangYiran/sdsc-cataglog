name: QSAR-TID-102391
dataset_id: 3645.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102391 contains information on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in neurotransmission. The dataset consists of key molecular descriptors like hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and topological indices, as well as the corresponding biological activity values. The data is derived from a study that involved 1,537 molecules, each assigned with a binary label indicating whether the compound inhibits the enzyme or not. The dataset aims to help researchers develop predictive models for the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which is relevant for the discovery of potential drugs against neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease.
