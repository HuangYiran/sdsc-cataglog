name: QSAR-TID-12619
dataset_id: 3448.0
description: QSAR-TID-12619 is a dataset that contains information about the biological activity of various chemical compounds. The dataset consists of 12619 instances with 41 input variables, including physical, topological, and geometrical properties of the compounds. The target variable of the dataset is the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), which indicates the effectiveness of the compounds in inhibiting a specific biological process. The dataset was collected and curated for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new chemical compounds. It provides valuable data and potential insights for researchers involved in drug discovery and design.
