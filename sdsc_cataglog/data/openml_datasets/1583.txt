name: QSAR-TID-30018
dataset_id: 3568.0
description: The QSAR-TID-30018 dataset is a collection of 1,105 compounds with binary values indicating their toxicity towards mice. The compounds possess various molecular descriptors, such as geometric, topological, and electronic properties. These descriptors provide insights into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the compounds. The dataset also includes information about the compounds' sources, classification, and toxicity levels. With this dataset, researchers can explore and develop models to predict the toxicity of new compounds based on their molecular features. Additionally, it facilitates the development of SAR models to understand the relationship between the chemical structure and toxicity.
