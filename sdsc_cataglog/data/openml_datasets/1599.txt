name: QSAR-TID-12665
dataset_id: 3584.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12665 consists of 12665 observations and 1026 molecular descriptors. It was compiled by extracting descriptors from the PUBCHEM database for toxicity prediction of chemical compounds. The target variable is the Negative Logarithm of the half-life in hours for a given compound. The dataset was further preprocessed by removing missing values and standardizing the descriptors. It is a balanced dataset, with 54% of the compounds having a half-life below 4 hours. QSAR-TID-12665 can be used for developing predictive models for chemical toxicity and to explore the relationship between molecular descriptors and compound half-life.
