name: QSAR-TID-100789
dataset_id: 3563.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100789 is a public repository that consists of 378 compounds and their respective biological activity values. The compounds belong to a family of molecules known as thiazolidinones and were synthesized for the purpose of investigating their potential to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in inflammation. Each compound is described by 41 molecular descriptors, which capture various chemical properties and structural characteristics. The biological activity values represent the potency of the compounds in inhibiting COX-2, measured as the negative logarithm of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (pIC50). It is a valuable resource for researchers interested in developing new COX-2 inhibitors or studying structure-activity relationships of thiazolidinones.
