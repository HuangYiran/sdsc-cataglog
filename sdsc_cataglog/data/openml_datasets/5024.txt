name: COIL2000-train
dataset_id: 45559.0
description: The COIL2000-train dataset is used for computer vision tasks, particularly object recognition. It contains 2,000 color images of 100 different objects, with each object having 20 images taken at different angles. The dataset provides a diverse range of object shapes and textures, making it suitable for testing and training computer vision algorithms. Each image is of size 32x32 pixels and has three color channels. This dataset is widely used in machine learning research and provides a benchmark for evaluating object recognition algorithms.
