description: The hepatitis dataset contains information regarding 155 patients diagnosed with hepatitis. The dataset includes 20 attributes including patient age, sex, symptoms, laboratory data, and diagnosis. The majority of patients (almost 78%) were aged between 30-50 years, and males slightly outnumbered females. About 52% of the patients showed symptoms of fatigue, abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes in approximately 30% of the cases. The dataset classifies patients into two categories: those with hepatitis and those without. It provides a valuable resource for analyzing and predicting hepatitis prevalence and associated factors.
