name: QSAR-TID-10486
dataset_id: 3798.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10486 contains information on 5,814 chemical compounds representing diverse structures. The chemical compounds were tested for their toxicity against the Vibrio fischeri bacteria, measuring luminescence inhibition in percentage. The dataset consists of various molecular descriptors, which are numerical values representing chemical properties such as molecular weight, solubility, and acidity. The descriptors include both 2D and 3D descriptors. The data is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of unknown compounds based on their molecular properties.
