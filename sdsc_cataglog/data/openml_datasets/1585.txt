name: QSAR-TID-12971
dataset_id: 3570.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12971 dataset is used for research in drug discovery and development. It consists of 1,428 compounds, each with 6 molecular descriptors and a binary output indicating its bioactivity. The dataset is aimed at predicting the ability of compounds to inhibit a specific enzyme involved in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The molecular descriptors include features like molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, and lipophilicity. The dataset is publicly available and has been used in multiple studies to develop predictive models and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms for drug discovery applications.
