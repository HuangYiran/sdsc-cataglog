name: QSAR-TID-100107
dataset_id: 3156.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100107 consists of 1058 chemical compounds, with 25 attributes for each compound. These attributes include molecular descriptors, experimentally-measured activities, and predicted activities for the compounds against 7 different biological targets. The dataset provides information about the structural properties and activities of these compounds, which can be used to develop predictive models in computational biology and drug discovery. The dataset is publicly available and was curated for use in QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) modeling and virtual screening tasks. It offers a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of chemoinformatics and drug development.
