name: QSAR-TID-101598
dataset_id: 3380.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101598 is composed of 1055 chemical compounds and their corresponding bioactivity data. The compounds are classified into three categories based on their bioactivity, which are active, moderately active, and inactive. The dataset contains various molecular descriptors that provide information about the compounds' chemical characteristics and structure, such as topological, thermodynamic, and electronic properties. These descriptors were calculated using computational methods. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models in the field of drug discovery and design. The bioactivity data and molecular descriptors make the dataset suitable for investigating the relationship between chemical structures and bioactivity levels.
