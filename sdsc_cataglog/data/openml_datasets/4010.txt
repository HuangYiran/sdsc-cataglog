name: superconduct
dataset_id: 44148.0
description: The dataset "superconduct" contains information about superconducting materials, their properties, and the critical temperature at which they transition to superconducting state. It consists of 21 columns that provide details on the chemical composition, lattice properties, electronic properties, and atomic properties of the materials. The dataset contains over 20,000 rows of data, each representing a different superconducting material. This dataset is valuable for researchers and scientists working in the field of superconductivity, as it can be used to analyze and predict properties and behaviors of new materials with potential superconducting capabilities.
