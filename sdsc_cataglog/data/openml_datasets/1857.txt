name: QSAR-TID-12413
dataset_id: 3842.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12413 contains information related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for a set of chemical compounds. It consists of 8,932 chemical compounds described by 1024 molecular descriptors that represent the structural and physicochemical characteristics of the compounds. The goal is to predict the biological activity of these compounds, specifically their inhibitory activity against thrombin, which is an important enzyme involved in the blood clotting process. This dataset can be useful for researchers and scientists working in pharmaceutical industries or drug discovery to develop new thrombin inhibitors based on the given molecular descriptors and their corresponding inhibitory activity values.
