name: QSAR-TID-10814
dataset_id: 3461.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10814 consists of molecular descriptors and the corresponding activity values of chemical compounds. These descriptors represent the structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds. The activity values indicate the biological response of the compounds, specifically their inhibition activity towards the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) enzyme. The dataset aims to enable the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the inhibition activity of new compounds against PTP1B. It contains 5,436 instances with six unique activity values. This dataset can be used for various chemoinformatics and computational biology studies focused on PTP1B inhibition.
