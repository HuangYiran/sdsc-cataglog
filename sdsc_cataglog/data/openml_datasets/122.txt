description: Libras_move is a dataset that contains motion capture data of 360 gestures made by 15 participants, each having a sensor attached to their right hand. The data captures various hand movements, including bending, waving, rotating, and closing the hand. The gestures were performed at different speeds and were recorded over two sessions. Each recorded gesture is represented by a time series of 45 attributes, including the angular position, velocity, and acceleration of the hand during the movement. This dataset is often used for pattern recognition and gesture classification research tasks.
