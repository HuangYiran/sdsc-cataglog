name: QSAR-TID-13004
dataset_id: 3789.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-13004 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It contains 7,866 instances and 229 features. The target variable represents the biological activity of the compounds, which is binary. The dataset has been extensively studied in the field of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling. The features in the dataset are calculated based on the structure and properties of the compounds, including topological and physicochemical descriptors. QSAR-TID-13004 is publicly available and has been used to develop predictive models for drug design and toxicity assessment. It is a valuable resource for researchers in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
