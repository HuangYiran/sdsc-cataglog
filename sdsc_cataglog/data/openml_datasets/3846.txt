name: MagicTelescope
dataset_id: 43971.0
description: The MagicTelescope dataset contains information about high-energy gamma rays detected by the MAGIC telescope located on the island of La Palma. It includes a total of 10,000 instances with 11 attributes, such as raw data values, time information, and location. The goal is to discern between gamma rays originating from celestial sources and those from the background. The majority of instances (67%) are gamma rays while the rest are background. The dataset is widely used in machine learning research to develop algorithms and models for gamma-ray flux predictions and background rejection, contributing to advancements in astrophysics and astronomy.
