name: QSAR-TID-13005
dataset_id: 3149.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-13005 contains molecular descriptors and bioactivity data for a set of compounds. It was compiled for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the bioactivity of compounds towards a specific target. The dataset includes 1055 compounds, with each compound having a set of 1332 molecular descriptors. The bioactivity values are binary variables indicating the compound's activity towards the target. This dataset enables researchers to develop QSAR models for screening and predicting the bioactivity of new compounds, contributing to drug discovery and development processes.
