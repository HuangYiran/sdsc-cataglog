name: QSAR-TID-11615
dataset_id: 3754.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11615 contains 2500 instances with 1024 attributes each. It consists of 16 target classes representing mutagenic compounds, where a compound is either mutagenic or non-mutagenic. The dataset aims to predict the mutagenicity of compounds based on their chemical structure. The compounds were tested in Salmonella typhimurium bacteria, and various molecular descriptors were calculated for each compound. The dataset also provides information about the test conditions and quality control. Several statistical measures are also included, such as statistical moments, graph and connectivity indices, and other physicochemical properties, making it a comprehensive dataset for mutagenicity prediction.
