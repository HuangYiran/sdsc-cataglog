name: Kuzushiji-MNIST
dataset_id: 41982.0
description: Kuzushiji-MNIST is a large-scale handwritten Japanese character dataset that aims to revive interest and research in Kuzushiji, an ancient script that was the most common writing system in Japan for centuries. It consists of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of Kuzushiji characters, converted into a format compatible with the classic MNIST dataset. The dataset includes 48 different characters and is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Kuzushiji-MNIST presents an opportunity for machine learning researchers to develop algorithms for digit recognition and character classification, preserving a rich cultural heritage.
