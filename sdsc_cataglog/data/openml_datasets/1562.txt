name: QSAR-TID-101473
dataset_id: 3546.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101473 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It consists of 7,442 compounds labeled as either active or inactive against a target enzyme. The dataset includes 1024 numerical features that represent the molecular structure and properties of the compounds. Each compound is characterized by its molecular weight, solubility, and various physicochemical properties. The aim of this dataset is to explore quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new compounds against the target enzyme based on their molecular features.
