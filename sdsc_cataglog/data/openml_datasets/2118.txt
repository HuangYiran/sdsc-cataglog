name: QSAR-TID-103062
dataset_id: 4104.0
description: The QSAR-TID-103062 dataset is used in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, specifically for the prediction of aquatic ecotoxicity. The dataset contains 1026 chemical compounds, along with their respective features such as molecular descriptors and fingerprint descriptors. The predicted target variable in this dataset is the logarithm of the concentration that causes 50% inhibition of luminescence in the bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers exploring QSAR models to predict the ecotoxicity of chemical compounds, aiding in the development of safer and more environmentally friendly substances.
