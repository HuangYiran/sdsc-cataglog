name: prnn_fglass
dataset_id: 952.0
description: The dataset prnn_fglass is a collection of 214 observations with 8 input features and 7 classes. It was created to predict the type of glass based on certain characteristics. The input features include refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium, and barium. The classes represent different types of glass, such as building windows, vehicle windows, containers, and tableware. The dataset has been used in various studies related to glass classification algorithms and pattern recognition. It is commonly employed as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of machine learning models in glass type prediction tasks.
