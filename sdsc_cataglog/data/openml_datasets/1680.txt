name: QSAR-TID-17033
dataset_id: 3663.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-17033 contains information about 4,451 chemical compounds with their corresponding toxicity values. The purpose of this dataset is to analyze and predict the toxicity of these compounds based on their chemical properties. The compounds are represented by 1024 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values that characterize different aspects of the compounds' structure and composition. The toxicity values range from 0.434 to 4.681, with an average of 1.507, and they were obtained through a toxicological experiment. This dataset can be useful for researchers and scientists working on toxicity prediction and drug discovery.
