name: QSAR-TID-13068
dataset_id: 3340.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-13068 is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities against a specific target. It contains 4,510 compounds and 1,106 features, including molecular descriptors, fingerprints, and topological indices. The compounds were classified into three categories based on their activity level: active, intermediate, and inactive. The dataset was created to develop predictive models for identifying potential drug candidates. It can be used for training machine learning algorithms and conducting structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. The dataset aims to aid in drug discovery and design by providing valuable insights into the relationship between molecular properties and biological activity.
