dataset_id: 45468.0
description: The dataset "timing-attack-dataset-64-micro-seconds-delay-2022-09-12" is about timing attacks and contains information collected with a 64-microsecond delay. It is scheduled for release on September 12, 2022. Timing attacks are a type of side-channel attack where an attacker exploits variations in the execution time of cryptographic algorithms to gain information about secret keys or sensitive data. This dataset likely includes data collected during such attacks, allowing researchers to analyze and understand the vulnerabilities associated with timing-based side-channel attacks. Its release will contribute to the ongoing research and development of countermeasures against timing attacks in cryptographic systems.
