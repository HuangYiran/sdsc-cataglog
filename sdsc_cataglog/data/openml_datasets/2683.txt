name: iris
dataset_id: 42011.0
description: The dataset iris contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of 150 iris flowers of three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). It is a popular dataset in the machine learning community. The measurements were collected by Ronald Fisher in 1936 to develop a statistical model to discriminate between the different species of iris flowers based on their characteristics. The dataset is widely used for classification tasks, and its simplicity and well-defined classes make it a good starting point for beginners in the field of machine learning.
