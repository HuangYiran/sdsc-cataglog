name: QSAR-TID-100436
dataset_id: 3417.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100436 consists of molecular descriptors and biological activities of 100K compounds. It aims to predict a compound's biological activity based on its molecular features. The compounds have been tested against multiple targets, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic agents. Various molecular descriptors, such as physicochemical, topological, and electronic properties, have been extracted for each compound. The dataset contains 8285 descriptors, including binary, nominal, and continuous data. The biological activities are represented by quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and given as continuous values. This dataset can be used for developing models to predict the biological activity of new compounds.
