name: anneal
dataset_id: 44265.0
description: The dataset "anneal" contains information about the steel annealing process. It includes 35 attributes describing different aspects of the annealing process, such as temperature, heating rate, and composition of the steel. The dataset consists of 798 samples, with each sample labeled as either '1' or '0' indicating whether the process was successful or not. The dataset is used to predict the outcome (success/failure) of future annealing processes based on the given attributes. The anneal dataset is frequently used in machine learning algorithms, particularly for classification tasks.
