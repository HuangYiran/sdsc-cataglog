name: QSAR-TID-10222
dataset_id: 3746.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10222 dataset contains information about different chemical compounds and their biological activities. It includes 801 compounds with 45 molecular descriptors, and the biological activity is represented by the experimental binding affinity against a specific target protein. The dataset is relevant for conducting quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies, which aim to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their chemical structure. The dataset can be used for developing machine learning models and algorithms for drug discovery and design. The information provided in this dataset can contribute to the development of more effective and targeted drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
