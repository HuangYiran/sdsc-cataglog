name: QSAR-TID-102420
dataset_id: 3913.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102420 is a collection of chemical compounds along with their quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) values. The dataset comprises 4,124 observations and 56 variables, including 54 molecular descriptors and 2 target variables. The descriptors represent various chemical properties such as molecular weight and geometric parameters. The first target variable denotes the toxicity of the compounds, while the second represents their mutagenicity. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of QSAR models for predicting the toxic and mutagenic effects of chemical compounds. It provides researchers with a valuable resource for studying and understanding the relationships between chemical structure and activity.
