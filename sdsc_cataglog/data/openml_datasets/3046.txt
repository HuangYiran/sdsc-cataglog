dataset_id: 42871.0
description: The iris dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in machine learning and statistical analysis. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers. The species are setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. It is often used for classification tasks, as the different species have distinct characteristics that can be identified based on the measurements. The iris dataset has become a benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms, and it has contributed to the development of various classification techniques.
