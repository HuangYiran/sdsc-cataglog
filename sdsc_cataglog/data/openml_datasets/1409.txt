name: QSAR-TID-12788
dataset_id: 3389.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12788 was used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds on Tetrahymena pyriformis, a freshwater ciliate protozoan. The dataset contains 2,788 compounds with 7,286 molecular descriptors. The compounds have been classified into three toxicity classes: highly toxic, moderately toxic, and non-toxic. The dataset includes information about the chemical structures and their corresponding toxicity class labels. QSAR models developed using this dataset have been found to have good predictive performance and can be useful in the prediction of toxicity for new chemical compounds.
