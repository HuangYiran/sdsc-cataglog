name: QSAR-TID-10620
dataset_id: 3964.0
description: QSAR-TID-10620 is a dataset consisting of 2957 chemical compounds. It was created for the purpose of predicting the mutagenic effect of chemicals through quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The dataset contains various attributes including molecular descriptors, such as atom count, bond count, and topological descriptors. These descriptors provide information about the structural properties of the compounds. The target variable is the mutagenicity, which indicates whether a chemical is mutagenic or non-mutagenic. The dataset has been used in the development and evaluation of QSAR models for mutagenicity prediction. It is publicly available and can be utilized for further research in chemoinformatics and toxicology.
