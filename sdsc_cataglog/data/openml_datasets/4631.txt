name: QSAR_fish_toxicity
dataset_id: 44970.0
description: The QSAR_fish_toxicity dataset consists of 908 chemical compounds with various molecular descriptors and their corresponding fish toxicity levels. The toxicity levels were determined using bioassays, measuring the median lethal concentration (LC50) values for a specific fish species. The dataset includes 6 input variables related to the chemical structure and 1 output variable representing the toxicity level. Some of the molecular descriptors provided include molecular weight, number of atoms, and topological indexes. The dataset's purpose is to explore the relationship between the chemical characteristics and the toxicity of the compounds, aiming to develop a predictive model for fish toxicity based on molecular descriptors.
