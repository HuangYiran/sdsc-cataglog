dataset_id: 3982.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12171 contains information on the biological activity of various compounds as potential inhibitors of the Tuberculosis (TB) protein. It consists of 356 compounds with their corresponding 56 molecular descriptors, such as electronic, steric, and topological properties. The dataset also includes two classes indicating the biological activity of the compounds: inactive (non-inhibitory) or active (inhibitory). The goal of this dataset is to develop a model that can accurately predict the biological activity of new compounds as potential TB inhibitors. This dataset can be useful for researchers and scientists working on drug discovery and development for tuberculosis.
