name: QSAR-TID-12469
dataset_id: 3678.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12469 consists of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. It contains 520 compounds, each described by 828 molecular descriptors. The target variable represents the inhibitory activity of these compounds on a specific enzyme (human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase). The dataset includes compounds with varying structures and properties, and the biological activities exhibit a wide range of values. QSAR-TID-12469 is used as a benchmark dataset in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, aimed at predicting the biological activities of new compounds based on their molecular features.
