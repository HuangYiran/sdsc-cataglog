name: QSAR-TID-10576
dataset_id: 3427.0
description: QSAR-TID-10576 is a dataset that comprises 4,834 chemical compounds with their corresponding target activity values. This dataset contains unique molecular fingerprints of these compounds, which are represented by binary features. These binary features are obtained from physicochemical properties and chemical composition of the compounds. The target activity values are continuous values that represent the bioactivity of the chemical compounds. QSAR-TID-10576 aims to provide information on the relationship between the chemical structure and the bioactivity of the compounds. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and predicting the bioactivity of similar compounds based on their molecular features.
