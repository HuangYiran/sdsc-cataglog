name: QSAR-TID-100415
dataset_id: 3652.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100415 contains information related to a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study on a set of chemical compounds. It consists of 1055 instances or samples, each representing a different compound, with each instance having 828 continuous-valued attributes. The aim of this study was to develop a model that could predict the toxicological properties of the compounds based on their structural features. The dataset includes information on the compounds' molecular and geometric descriptors, as well as their experimental log toxicity values. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scientists working in the field of toxicology and chemical structure-activity relationship analysis.
