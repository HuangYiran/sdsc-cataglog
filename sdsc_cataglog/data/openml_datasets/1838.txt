name: QSAR-TID-103
dataset_id: 3823.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103 consists of 1813 observations and 1026 features. The dataset aims to predict the acute aquatic toxicity of various chemical compounds. The target variable, toxicity, is represented by LC50 values, which indicate the concentration needed to cause death in 50% of the test organisms. The compounds' molecular descriptors were calculated using software packages like Dragon and Symyx. Features include different types of structural, topological, and electrostatic properties. The data shows a wide range of toxicity values, allowing for the identification of relationships between molecular properties and toxicity. This dataset can be used for machine learning models to predict aquatic toxicity of chemicals.
