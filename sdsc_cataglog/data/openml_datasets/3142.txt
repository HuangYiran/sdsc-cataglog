description: The dataset "leaktest" is a collection of 1.4 billion email addresses and 2 billion usernames exposed to the public. The data dump was discovered by cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt, who made the information freely available on his website, Have I Been Pwned. The leaked data is a result of several breaches from various sources. In this latest incident, the dataset contains previously undisclosed email and username combinations from multiple breaches. Hunt decided to release this collection to help individuals determine if their personal information is compromised, encouraging people to use stronger passwords and enable multi-factor authentication to protect themselves.
