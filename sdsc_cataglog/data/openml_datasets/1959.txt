name: QSAR-TID-35
dataset_id: 3944.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-35 consists of 899 organic compounds, each characterized by 35 molecular descriptors. These descriptors include features such as molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient, and surface area. The dataset represents a binary classification problem where the compounds are classified as either toxic or non-toxic. The toxic class contains 609 compounds, while the non-toxic class consists of 290 compounds. This dataset can be used for developing computational models to predict the toxicity of organic compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset is publicly available and can contribute to the development of toxicology prediction models.
