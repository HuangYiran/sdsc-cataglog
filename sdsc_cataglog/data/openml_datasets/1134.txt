name: QSAR-TID-10766
dataset_id: 3110.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10766 contains information on the biological activity of compounds against a specific target. The dataset includes 3,008 compounds, with each compound having 178 molecular descriptors. The biological activity of the compounds is represented by the logarithm of the inhibition constant (pIC50). The target of interest is the enzyme tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2, which is associated with certain diseases. The dataset was created for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds. It can be used for machine learning and predictive modeling tasks in drug design and discovery.
