name: mfeat-karhunen
dataset_id: 1020.0
description: The dataset mfeat-karhunen is used for studying the features of handwritten digits. It consists of 2,000 samples of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each sample is stored as a 400-dimensional vector, where each dimension represents a pixel intensity value. The dataset is divided into five different sets: the first four sets are used for training purposes, and the fifth set is reserved for testing. The purpose of this dataset is to provide researchers with a reliable and well-defined dataset for studying and analyzing various algorithms related to handwritten digit recognition.
