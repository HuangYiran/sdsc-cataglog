name: QSAR-TID-12294
dataset_id: 3628.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12294 consists of 1,326 chemical compounds, with each compound represented by various molecular descriptors that provide information about their structure and properties. These descriptors include electronic, geometrical, constitutional, and topological attributes. The dataset also includes the logarithmic value of the half-life of the compounds in water, which is an important measure of their stability. QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models can be developed using this dataset to predict the half-life of unknown compounds, allowing for the rapid assessment of their environmental behavior and potential toxicity. The dataset is publicly available and can be used by researchers and developers in the field of chemical and environmental sciences.
