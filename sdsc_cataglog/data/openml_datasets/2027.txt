name: QSAR-TID-12268
dataset_id: 4013.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12268 contains chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It consists of 7,269 compounds, each described by 1,279 molecular descriptors. The biological activity is quantified using a measure known as the logarithm of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (pIC50) against the human Abl kinase enzyme. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for various purposes, such as developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds. QSAR-TID-12268 provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field of medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.
