name: QSAR-TID-10058
dataset_id: 3398.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10058 consists of 1055 compounds, each represented by 919 molecular descriptors. It is primarily designed for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and drug design applications. The compounds cover a wide range of structural diversity and physicochemical properties. The dataset includes information about the biological activities of the compounds, specifically their inhibition constant (Ki) against the target enzyme. The target enzyme is important in the treatment of several diseases, making this dataset valuable for drug discovery research. It is publicly available and can be used to develop robust computational models for predicting the inhibitory activity of new compounds against the target enzyme.
