name: QSAR-TID-101237
dataset_id: 3514.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101237 dataset consists of 1403 instances with 41 attributes, including one target attribute. It was created for the prediction of the mutagenic effect caused by chemical compounds. The target attribute is a binary variable that classifies compounds as "mutagenic" or "non-mutagenic". The dataset contains information about structural, topological, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical features of compounds. The data was collected and curated from various sources, including scientific literature, databases, and expert knowledge. The dataset has been extensively used for developing computational models to predict mutagenicity and to explore the relationship between molecular features and mutagenic activity.
