name: 20_newsgroups.drift
dataset_id: 40517.0
description: The dataset 20_newsgroups.drift consists of a collection of documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is a widely used benchmark for text classification and clustering tasks. The documents in this dataset have been selected to depict the concept drift phenomenon, where the statistical properties of the data change over time. Concept drift is an important problem in various real-world applications, and this dataset provides researchers with a valuable resource for studying and developing algorithms to handle such drift. The goal of 20_newsgroups.drift is to enable the evaluation of concept drift detection and adaptation methods by offering a realistic and challenging scenario for experimentation and analysis.
