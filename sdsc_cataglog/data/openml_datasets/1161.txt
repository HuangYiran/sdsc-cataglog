name: QSAR-TID-100286
dataset_id: 3137.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100286 contains information about 100286 different compounds. It includes multiple molecular descriptors for each compound, such as topological, geometric, and electronic properties. The dataset also provides a binary classification, indicating if the compound is active or inactive against a specific biological target. The compounds were obtained from the World Drug Index and PubChem databases, and their properties were calculated using the Dragon software. This dataset can be used for developing machine learning models to predict the activity of compounds against the target, aiding in drug discovery and design processes.
