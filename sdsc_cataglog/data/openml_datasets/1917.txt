name: QSAR-TID-10577
dataset_id: 3902.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10577 contains information on 10577 chemical compounds. It includes 102 numerical descriptors extracted from their molecular structures, as well as their corresponding biological activities (target values). These target values represent the toxicity of the compounds, which were measured using the Vibrio fischeri bacteria assay. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of models that can predict the toxicity of chemical compounds based on their molecular structures. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for various purposes, such as building predictive models, feature selection, or exploring the relationship between molecular features and toxicity.
