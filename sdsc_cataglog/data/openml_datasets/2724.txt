name: iris
dataset_id: 42098.0
description: The iris dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in machine learning. It contains several measurements of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset consists of 150 samples, representing three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has measurements for all four features. This dataset is often used for classification tasks, as it provides a good foundation for exploring supervised learning algorithms. Its popularity stems from its simplicity, availability, and clear separation of classes, making it ideal for experimentation and evaluation of machine learning models.
