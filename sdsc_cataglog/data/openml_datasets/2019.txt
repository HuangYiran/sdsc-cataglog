name: QSAR-TID-48
dataset_id: 4005.0
description: QSAR-TID-48 is a dataset consisting of 4765 molecules, each represented by 828 molecular descriptors, and is used for modeling and predicting the acute aquatic toxicity of organic compounds. The dataset includes binary class labels indicating whether each molecule is toxic or non-toxic. It was collected and curated from various sources such as research papers, patents, and databases. The molecular descriptors capture important structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds. QSAR-TID-48 has been widely used by researchers in developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of new chemicals, aiming to facilitate the risk assessment and regulatory decision-making process in the field of environmental toxicology.
