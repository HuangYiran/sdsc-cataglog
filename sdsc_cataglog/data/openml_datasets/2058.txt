name: QSAR-TID-100862
dataset_id: 4044.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100862 consists of 1054 instances, where each instance represents a compound along with its chemical and biological descriptors. These descriptors include molecular properties like molecular weight, molar refractivity, and topological indices. The biological activity of each compound is also recorded, indicating whether it is active or inactive against a specific biological target. The dataset was created to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model that predicts the biological activity of compounds based on their descriptors. The dataset has been utilized to construct machine learning models to explore the relationship between chemical properties and biological activity, assisting in drug discovery and design processes.
