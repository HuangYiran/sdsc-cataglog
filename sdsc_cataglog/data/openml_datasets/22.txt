name: colic
dataset_id: 27.0
description: The dataset colic, originally obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of 368 records of horses showing colic symptoms. Each record includes 27 attributes representing various medical and demographic features. The dataset is intended for classification tasks with the goal to diagnose colic in horses. However, the presence of missing values and some categorical attributes requiring interpretation makes it challenging. It has been used in research to develop prediction models and algorithms for colic diagnosis, contributing to the advancement of equine veterinary medicine. This dataset offers valuable insights for researchers interested in equine health and machine learning algorithms.
