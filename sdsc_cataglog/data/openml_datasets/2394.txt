description: The Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn is a widely used dataset consisting of ten physiological features that are measured in 442 diabetes patients. The features include age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. This dataset is frequently employed in machine learning and statistical model selection due to its relevance to diabetes research. It helps in understanding relationships between various factors and the progression of the disease, as well as enables the development of predictive models for diabetes progression.
