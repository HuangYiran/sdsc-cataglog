name: QSAR-TID-100590
dataset_id: 3214.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100590 contains 1133 instances, each with nine attributes and a target variable. The target variable is a measure of the biological activity of molecules against Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The attributes include physicochemical properties of the molecules, such as molecular weight and the presence of specific functional groups. The dataset was created to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the biological activity of molecules that could be potential drugs against Chagas disease. QSAR models are used to analyze and interpret the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity in drug discovery and development.
