name: QSAR-TID-12391
dataset_id: 3228.0
description: QSAR-TID-12391 is a dataset that focuses on the prediction of toxicological properties using molecular descriptors. It contains information about 3,471 different compounds represented by 7,711 descriptors. The dataset includes both numeric and binary variables, providing information about various molecular properties. These descriptors were extracted from molecular structures and used to predict the binding affinity of compounds to the estrogen receptor. The dataset is primarily used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and analyzing the relationships between molecular properties and toxicological effects. It is publicly available and can be utilized for various research purposes in the field of toxicology.
