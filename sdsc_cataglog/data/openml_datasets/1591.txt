name: QSAR-TID-100895
dataset_id: 3576.0
description: The QSAR-TID-100895 dataset consists of 1,018 chemical compounds with their associated measured inhibitory activity against the target protein dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The dataset includes various molecular descriptors such as physicochemical and topological properties. Each compound is represented by a 2D structural formula and is labeled with its corresponding biological activity. The objective of this dataset is to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds against DHFR based on their molecular features. The dataset has been utilized in a study to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for DHFR inhibitors, aiming to aid in drug design and discovery processes.
