name: QSAR-TID-10850
dataset_id: 3309.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10850 is a collection of chemical compounds gathered for the purpose of predicting their toxicity. It contains 899 different compounds, each described by 128 molecular descriptors. The properties of the compounds were calculated using molecular simulation software. The toxicity was measured using the Tetrahymena pyriformis toxicity test, which is widely used in toxicology. The dataset includes information about the experimental conditions during the testing, such as temperature and pH. This dataset serves as a useful resource for developing predictive models and studying the relationship between molecular properties and toxicity.
