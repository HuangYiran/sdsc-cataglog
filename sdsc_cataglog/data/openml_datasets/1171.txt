name: QSAR-TID-100027
dataset_id: 3147.0
description: The QSAR-TID-100027 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds with known biological activities, provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute. The dataset contains 1,129 compounds and their corresponding biological activity values, represented as binary variables (active or inactive). The compounds are curated from various sources and tested against a specific biological target. Additional descriptors like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donor, and acceptor count are provided for each compound. This dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds, supporting drug discovery and development processes.
