description: The dataset Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection is a collection of credit card transactions with the objective of identifying fraudulent activities. The dataset contains over 284,000 transactions, recorded over a span of two days, with 492 cases of fraud. The data attributes include transaction amount, time, and 28 anonymized features, obtained through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. The dataset is highly imbalanced, as the majority of transactions are non-fraudulent. Therefore, effective fraud detection algorithms need to address this class imbalance. The dataset is valuable for developing and evaluating credit card fraud detection models, contributing to the prevention and mitigation of financial fraud.
