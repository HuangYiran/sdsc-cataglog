name: QSAR-TID-12263
dataset_id: 3909.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12263 contains information on various chemical compounds and their biological activities. It comprises of 4,486 instances and 102 attributes. The dataset has been created for modeling the relation between structure-activity relationships (SAR) of organic compounds and various physicochemical properties. The molecular descriptors considered in this dataset provide information about the chemical properties of the compounds, while the target variable represents their biological activity. The dataset also includes binary attributes that specify the toxicological class of the compounds. This dataset can be used for developing predictive models to assess the biological activity and toxicity of chemical compounds.
