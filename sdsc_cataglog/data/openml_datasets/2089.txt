name: QSAR-TID-10434
dataset_id: 4075.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10434 dataset contains information about the biological activities of a set of compounds. It provides data on chemical compounds, their molecular structures, and their corresponding inhibitory activities against a certain protein target. The dataset includes molecular descriptors that describe the physical and chemical properties of the compounds. These descriptors are generated using a software program called Dragon. The dataset also contains the inhibitory activities of the compounds against the protein target, which are expressed as IC50 values. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activities of similar compounds against the protein target.
