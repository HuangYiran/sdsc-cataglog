name: QSAR-TID-10958
dataset_id: 3574.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10958 dataset consists of chemical compounds with annotated biological activity values. It includes 7,257 compounds and 102 descriptors. The target variable is a binary classification indicating whether the compound is active or inactive. The descriptors provide information about the structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds. The dataset was generated using computational methods and has been extensively used for the development and evaluation of predictive models. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of computational chemistry, specifically for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models.
