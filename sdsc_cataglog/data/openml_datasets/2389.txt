dataset_id: 41511.0
description: The iris dataset is a widely-used dataset in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Created by the British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936, this dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset due to its simplicity and accessibility. It contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. The iris dataset is commonly used for exploring classification algorithms and can help in understanding the concept of clustering.
