name: QSAR-TID-30005
dataset_id: 3695.0
description: QSAR-TID-30005 is a dataset consisting of molecular descriptors and the corresponding toxicity scores for 8452 chemical compounds. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds. It includes 1444 molecular descriptors, such as topological, constitutional, and electronic properties. The toxicity scores range from -1 to 1, representing different levels of toxicity. QSAR-TID-30005 is useful for researchers and experts in the field of computational chemistry to understand the relationship between molecular properties and toxicity and to develop predictive models for assessing chemical safety.
