description: The dataset Colon consists of histopathological images taken from colon tissues. It contains a total of 5000 images, divided evenly into five classes: normal tissue, adenomatous, hyperplastic, serrated, and malignant colorectal cancer. The dataset aims to aid in the development of accurate computer-aided systems for diagnosing colorectal cancer through image analysis. Each image is accompanied by a corresponding binary mask with pixel-level annotations denoting the regions of interest. The dataset was collected from diverse sources, including various hospitals, laboratories, and archives. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers working on colon tissue analysis, cancer detection, and image processing for medical applications.
