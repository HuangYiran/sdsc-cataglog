name: QSAR-TID-247
dataset_id: 3354.0
description: QSAR-TID-247 is a dataset containing information about compounds and their properties. The dataset includes data on 247 different compounds, and each compound is described by 42 molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide information about various aspects of the compounds, such as their size, shape, and electronic properties. The dataset also includes a target variable, which represents the activity of the compounds against a specific target. The dataset is widely used in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, where the goal is to predict the activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
