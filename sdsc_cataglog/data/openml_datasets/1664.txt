name: QSAR-TID-19639
dataset_id: 3647.0
description: The QSAR-TID-19639 dataset is composed of 19639 compounds with their corresponding quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) values. The compounds are represented by their chemical structure, and their activity against a particular target is measured. The dataset provides information on various molecular properties, such as molecular weight, atom count, topological indices, and partial charge values. Moreover, it includes values indicating the compound's electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric properties. The dataset aims to support researchers in developing QSAR models for predicting the activity of compounds against the target. The data can be utilized for training and testing machine learning algorithms in the field of drug discovery and molecular design.
