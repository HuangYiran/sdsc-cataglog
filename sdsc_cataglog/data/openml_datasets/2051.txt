name: QSAR-TID-11286
dataset_id: 4037.0
description: QSAR-TID-11286 represents a dataset focused on the quality of the Hm values for a set of 10 nanoparticles. The dataset provides a combination of descriptors: 2227 from RP, 783 from RDF, and 141 from AutoCorrelation. It also includes a target variable "Hm" representing the ratio of surface strain energy to the total energy of the particles. The values of Hm range from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate higher quality nanoparticles. The objective of this dataset is to build a regression model for predicting Hm based on the provided descriptors, contributing to the advancement of nanoparticle research and development.
