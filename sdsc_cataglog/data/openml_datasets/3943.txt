name: SGEMM_GPU_kernel_performance
dataset_id: 44069.0
description: The dataset SGEMM_GPU_kernel_performance includes performance metrics of 114,553 GPU runs of the matrix-multiply operation for a scientific computing task. The data consists of 14 attributes, including runtimes, input and output matrix sizes, kernel dimensions, thread block sizes, and warehouse parameters. The dataset aims to study the performance optimization of GPU kernels using matrix multiplication as a representative kernel. Exploratory data analysis shows high correlation between certain variables, indicating potential for dimensionality reduction techniques. The dataset can be used to develop machine learning models to predict performance and optimize GPU kernels for scientific computing applications.
