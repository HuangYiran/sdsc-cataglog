description: The iris dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning research. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The measurements include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of using this dataset is to classify new iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements. The iris dataset is commonly used to demonstrate classification techniques as it provides a simple and straightforward example.
