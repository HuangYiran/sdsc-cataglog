name: QSAR-TID-10373
dataset_id: 3348.0
description: QSAR-TID-10373 is a dataset consisting of 1105 chemical compounds with their corresponding 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. These descriptors have been generated using Dragon software. The dataset also includes the pIGC50 values, which represent the inhibitory concentration of compounds against the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme. The compounds range from highly active to highly inactive against the enzyme, providing a wide range of pIGC50 values for analysis. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of compounds against the enzyme.
