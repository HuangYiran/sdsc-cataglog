name: QSAR-TID-101183
dataset_id: 3587.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101183 consists of 283 chemicals along with various molecular descriptors and their corresponding aquatic toxicity values. These chemicals are categorized into three classes based on their toxicity levels. The dataset aims to predict the aquatic toxicity of these chemicals using regression analysis. The molecular descriptors provided include both 2D and 3D properties, including atomic contribution descriptors, atom-type electrotopological state indices, and atom-type connectivity indices. The dataset is valuable for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to help predict the toxicity of new or untested chemicals, which can be useful for regulatory purposes and risk assessment in the field of environmental chemistry.
