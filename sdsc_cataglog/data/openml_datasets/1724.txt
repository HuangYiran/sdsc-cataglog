name: QSAR-TID-25
dataset_id: 3707.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-25 consists of 676 chemical compounds with 1017 pairs of inputs and outputs. It is designed for the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, considering the inhibition of catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) as the output variable. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors based on hydrogen bonding, shape, and size. It also contains auxiliary information like molecular weight, topological indices, and electronic properties. The dataset aims to facilitate the development and evaluation of QSAR models for predicting COMT inhibition, which can help in drug design and discovery.
