name: synthetic_control
dataset_id: 377.0
description: The synthetic_control dataset is a time series dataset used for evaluating clustering algorithms. It consists of six clusters, with each cluster representing a different group of synthetic control time series. The data was generated to simulate the behavior of a control group before and after a treatment period. Each time series has 60 observations. The dataset is commonly used in the field of machine learning to assess the effectiveness of clustering algorithms on time series data. It provides a benchmark for measuring the performance of clustering techniques in identifying similarities and differences among time series datasets.
