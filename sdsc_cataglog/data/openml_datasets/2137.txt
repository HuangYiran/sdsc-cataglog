name: QSAR-TID-101332
dataset_id: 4123.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101332 contains information on the biological activity of different chemicals. It consists of 471 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activity values. The compounds are represented by 13 molecular descriptors that provide information about their structural and physicochemical properties. These descriptors include topological, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical features. The biological activity values are given in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and half maximal effective concentration (EC50). The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and predicting the biological activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
