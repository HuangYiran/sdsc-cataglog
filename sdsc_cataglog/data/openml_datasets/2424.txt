description: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing information about different species of Iris flowers. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 as a way to demonstrate the use of linear discriminant analysis. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three different species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). For each sample, four features are measured: the length and width of the sepals and petals. The Iris dataset has become a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used to demonstrate various classification algorithms.
