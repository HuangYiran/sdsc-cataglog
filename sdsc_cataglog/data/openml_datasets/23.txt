name: optdigits
dataset_id: 28.0
description: The optdigits dataset consists of images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is a 32x32 pixel binary representation of a digit. There are 5,620 instances in the dataset, divided into 10 classes (one for each digit). Each instance has 64 input features, representing the grayscale value of each pixel. The dataset was created by collecting digit samples from 43 individual contributors. It is often used for classification tasks in machine learning research, with performance evaluation typically reported using accuracy or error rate metrics.
