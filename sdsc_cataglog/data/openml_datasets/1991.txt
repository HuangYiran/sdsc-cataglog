name: QSAR-TID-11094
dataset_id: 3977.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11094 consists of 4,056 chemical compounds and their corresponding quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) values. The compounds are described by 1,187 molecular descriptors, including atomic and bond properties, topological indices, and molecular properties. The QSAR values represent the compounds' inhibitory activity against various biological targets. Some compounds have multiple activity values due to different target assays. The dataset also includes additional information such as compound names, standard test codes, and source details. The dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for developing QSAR models and predicting the inhibitory activity of new compounds against specific biological targets.
