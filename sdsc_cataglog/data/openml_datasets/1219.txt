name: QSAR-TID-100857
dataset_id: 3195.0
description: The QSAR-TID-100857 dataset is a collection of chemical compounds used for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis. It contains information about 1057 chemical compounds, each described by 1024 molecular descriptors. These descriptors represent various physical and chemical properties of the compounds. The dataset also includes the activity values of each compound, indicating their potential toxicity. The aim of this dataset is to develop predictive models that can estimate the toxicity of new compounds based on their molecular features. It can be used for machine learning algorithms to create models for toxicity prediction, allowing for safer and more efficient drug discovery and chemical synthesis processes.
