description: The QSAR-TID-101607 dataset is a collection of molecular descriptors and calculated toxicity values of 1057 compounds. The dataset was generated to predict the acute toxicity of chemical compounds towards the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). The molecular descriptors include information about chemical structure, topology, electronic properties, and hydrophobicity. The toxicity values are given in the form of LC50 (median lethal concentration), representing the concentration at which 50% of the fish population dies within a specified exposure time. This dataset can be used for developing QSAR models to predict and evaluate the toxicity of new chemical compounds.
