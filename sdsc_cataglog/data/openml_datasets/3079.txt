name: alcohol-qcm-sensor
dataset_id: 42930.0
description: The alcohol-qcm-sensor dataset consists of measurements obtained from a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor for the detection of alcohol vapors. The sensor was exposed to different concentrations of alcohol vapors to record frequency shifts in the sensor response. The dataset contains 1367 instances with 6 numeric attributes. The attributes include sensor frequency, alcohol concentration, temperature, humidity, flow rate, and time since last calibration. The dataset aims to explore the relationship between these attributes and the measured frequency shifts, providing insights for the development of alcohol vapor sensors and their potential applications in breathalyzer technologies and alcohol detection systems.
