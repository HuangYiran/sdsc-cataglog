name: QSAR-TID-12673
dataset_id: 3352.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12673 contains information about molecular descriptors and the anticancer activity of compounds. It consists of 3941 unique compounds, each described by 28 different attributes. These attributes include topological, constitutional, and electrostatic descriptors. The dataset aims to predict if a compound has anticancer activity or not based on these descriptors. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 11% of compounds labeled as active against cancer. The data can be used to build models or perform experiments to predict the anticancer activity of compounds and aid in drug discovery research.
