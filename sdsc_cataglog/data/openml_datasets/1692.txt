name: QSAR-TID-10908
dataset_id: 3675.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10908 contains 164 chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. The compounds belong to a class of substances known as quinoline derivatives, which have potential antimicrobial properties. Each compound is represented by a set of molecular descriptors, such as chemical structure and physicochemical properties. The biological activity is measured in terms of inhibition concentration, which indicates the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting the growth of certain microorganisms. The dataset is useful for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the antimicrobial activity of new quinoline derivatives, and for further research in the field of drug discovery.
