name: QSAR-TID-101182
dataset_id: 3508.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101182 is used to study the predictive quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. It contains 1,211 molecules with their corresponding antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The molecules are described by 41 molecular descriptors, including physicochemical, topological, and electronic properties. The aim of the dataset is to develop a regression model that can predict the antifungal activity of molecules based on their molecular descriptors. This dataset can be useful in designing new molecules with improved antifungal potency. The dataset is publicly available and can be utilized for further research in the field of QSAR modeling for antifungal drugs.
