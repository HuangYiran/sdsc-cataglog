name: QSAR-TID-11634
dataset_id: 4058.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11634 is a publicly available dataset used for predicting the acute toxicity of chemicals to the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) fish species. It contains information about 7,008 chemical compounds and their associated biological activity values. The dataset was created by collecting, curating, and integrating data from various sources. The chemicals in the dataset possess diverse structural and physicochemical properties, making it suitable for developing predictive models. The dataset includes features such as molecular descriptors, fingerprints, and structural properties, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for toxicity prediction. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of computational toxicology.
