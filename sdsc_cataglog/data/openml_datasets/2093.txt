name: QSAR-TID-103106
dataset_id: 4079.0
description: QSAR-TID-103106 is a dataset related to the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) study, which aims to predict chemical activity based on structural properties. It consists of 8,384 compounds with corresponding experimental data for their biological activity. The compounds are structurally diverse and come from various sources, including drugs, toxins, and natural products. The dataset incorporates 2D and 3D molecular descriptors that quantitatively represent the compounds' structure. Additionally, it includes various response variables, including cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and anti-HIV activity. QSAR-TID-103106 serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and analyzing the relationship between chemical structure and activity for a wide range of compounds.
