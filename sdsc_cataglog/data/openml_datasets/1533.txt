name: QSAR-TID-87
dataset_id: 3517.0
description: QSAR-TID-87 is a dataset containing information about the toxicity levels of chemical compounds. It consists of 425 compounds and 21 molecular descriptors, along with their corresponding toxicity values. The dataset was developed for the purpose of predicting the toxicity of new compounds based on their molecular features. The toxicity values were obtained through experiments conducted on rats, and the molecular descriptors were calculated using quantum chemical calculations. The dataset is freely available and can be used for various purposes, such as developing machine learning models for toxicity prediction or conducting research on chemical compounds.
