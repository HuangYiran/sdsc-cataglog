name: prnn_fglass
dataset_id: 996.0
description: The dataset prnn_fglass contains information about glass samples, specifically the refractive index and nine attributes about their chemical composition. The dataset consists of 214 instances, each labeled with one of six classes representing different types of glass. Class 1 represents building_windows_float_processed, class 2 represents building_windows_non_float_processed, class 3 represents vehicle_windows_float_processed, class 4 represents containers, class 5 represents tableware, and class 6 represents headlamps. The dataset is substantial, with good class distribution among the various glass types. It can be used for classification tasks or studying glass properties and chemical composition patterns.
