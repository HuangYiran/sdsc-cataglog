dataset_id: 3481.0
description: The dataset, QSAR-TID-12787, is a collection of chemical compounds' attributes and their bioactivity data. The compounds belong to a group of xanthine derivatives, which are substances that can affect the central nervous system. The dataset provides 250 chemical compounds and their 15 different attributes, including topological and electronic features. The bioactivity information is represented by the logarithm of the activity against a receptor, denoted as pIC50 values. The dataset was developed for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict the bioactivity of compounds based on their attributes.
