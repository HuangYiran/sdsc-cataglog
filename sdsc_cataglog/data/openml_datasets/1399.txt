name: QSAR-TID-11084
dataset_id: 3378.0
description: QSAR-TID-11084 is a dataset compiled to aid in the prediction of the toxicological properties of chemicals. It contains information on 7,039 chemical compounds, including their structural and physicochemical characteristics. The dataset features 9 molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond count, and octanol-water partition coefficient. Moreover, it provides binary classification labels to indicate whether a compound is toxic or non-toxic. The dataset is relevant for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to identify potentially harmful chemicals. The compounds in the dataset have been extensively studied and are annotated with various toxicity endpoints, making QSAR-TID-11084 a valuable resource for toxicity prediction research.
