name: QSAR-TID-11239
dataset_id: 3973.0
description: QSAR-TID-11239 is a dataset consisting of 4,135 chemical compounds with 22 features extracted from these compounds. These features include topological, physicochemical, constitutional, and shape-based properties. The target variable in this dataset is the toxicity of the compounds, which is categorized into two classes: non-toxic and toxic. The dataset is highly imbalanced with a majority of compounds being non-toxic. The data was collected to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the toxicity of compounds based on their features. This dataset is widely used in research studies to explore various machine learning and QSAR techniques for toxicological prediction.
