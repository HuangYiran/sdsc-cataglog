name: BNG(ionosphere)
dataset_id: 40518.0
description: The BNG (ionosphere) dataset is focused on predicting the presence of ionospheric abnormalities detected by a continuous wave radar. It consists of 351 observations with 34 attributes, including radar returns, signal strength, geographical and geometric aspects, and much more. The target variable is binary, indicating whether ionospheric abnormalities were detected or not. The data may be challenging to analyze due to the presence of outliers and missing values. However, the dataset has been widely used for researching pattern recognition algorithms and machine learning techniques to distinguish between good and bad ionospheric radar echoes.
