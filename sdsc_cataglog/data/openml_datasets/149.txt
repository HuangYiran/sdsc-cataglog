name: codrna
dataset_id: 351.0
description: The codrna dataset comprises gene expression data from fruit flies, specifically their embryonic development stage. It includes information about the expression levels of genes at various time points during the development process. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the gene expression patterns during embryogenesis, allowing researchers to study the genetic mechanisms underlying fruit fly development. The codrna dataset offers valuable insights into the gene regulatory networks and molecular processes involved in embryonic development, aiding in the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and understanding developmental disorders. It is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of developmental biology.
