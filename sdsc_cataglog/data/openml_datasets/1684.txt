name: QSAR-TID-10964
dataset_id: 3667.0
description: QSAR-TID-10964 is a publicly available dataset containing information on 8,736 chemical compounds. The dataset includes various descriptors related to the compounds, such as structural and electrotopological properties, as well as biological activities and toxicological effects. The compounds have been categorized into two classes: active and inactive, based on their inhibitory activity against a specific protein target. The dataset also provides information on the experimental conditions under which the biological activities were measured. This dataset can be utilized for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and predicting the inhibitory activity of new chemical compounds against the protein target.
