name: QSAR-TID-20084
dataset_id: 3781.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-20084 consists of chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities against a specific enzyme. It includes 20084 instances and 8285 attributes, making it a large dataset. The compounds are represented by their molecular descriptors, such as hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, and polarizability. The biological activities are expressed as IC50 values, which represent the concentration of the compound required to inhibit the enzyme by 50%. The dataset aims to predict the inhibitory potency of the compounds based on their molecular features. It can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship models and analyzing the relationship between a compound's structure and its biological activity.
