name: QSAR-TID-11209
dataset_id: 3520.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11209 contains data related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of compounds. It focuses on investigating the toxicity of certain compounds. The dataset includes information about the chemical structure of the compounds, as well as their experimental toxicity values. The aim of this dataset is to develop predictive models to determine the toxicity of new compounds based on their chemical properties. The dataset consists of 286 compounds and 12 features, and the toxicity values range from 0.048 to 5.59. This dataset can be used for QSAR modeling and toxicity prediction research.
