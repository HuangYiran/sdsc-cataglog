dataset_id: 42021.0
description: The iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of four different features of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features are used to classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. It is a balanced dataset, making it suitable for classification tasks and evaluating machine learning algorithms. The iris dataset is widely used for benchmarking and testing algorithms and has become a standard dataset in the field.
