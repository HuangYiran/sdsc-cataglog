name: QSAR-TID-12806
dataset_id: 3869.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12806 contains information about chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities against a specific target protein. The dataset comprises 977 compounds with 821 molecular descriptors that provide detailed characteristics of each compound. These descriptors include topological, constitutional, and physicochemical properties. The dataset also includes the activity values, which were measured using a specific biological assay. The objective of analyzing this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that can predict the activity of new compounds against the target protein based on their molecular descriptors.
