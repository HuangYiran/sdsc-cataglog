name: QSAR-TID-12825
dataset_id: 3772.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12825 contains information about 386 chemical compounds. It includes 828 molecular descriptors and one target variable called "pIC50." The compounds are classified into three classes: active, moderately active, and inactive. The data was used to develop a QSAR model to predict the activity of compounds against a particular target. The dataset was divided into training and test sets, with 231 compounds in the training set and 155 in the test set. The model achieved relatively high accuracy in predicting the activity of compounds and can be useful for drug discovery and development.
