name: QSAR-TID-100432
dataset_id: 3495.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100432 contains information about a series of compounds and their respective biological activities. It consists of 540 compounds and 960 molecular descriptors. The compounds have been classified into two classes, active and inactive, based on their activity against a specific biological target. The dataset aims to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The molecular descriptors capture various aspects of the compounds' chemical structures and properties. The dataset is publicly available and can be utilized for tasks such as predicting the activity of new compounds and understanding the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity.
