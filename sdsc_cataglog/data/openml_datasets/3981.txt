dataset_id: 44119.0
description: The MiniBooNE dataset is a collection of experimental data obtained from the Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment conducted at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. It contains information about the interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos with a carbon target in a 40 feet spherical detector. The dataset consists of approximately one million events, representing a sample of neutrino and antineutrino interactions detected over a period of six years. The primary goal of the experiment was to investigate anomalies observed in earlier experiments related to the oscillation of neutrinos and antineutrinos between different types. The MiniBooNE dataset is widely used for statistical analysis and scientific research in the field of particle physics.
