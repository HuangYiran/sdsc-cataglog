name: QSAR-TID-13024
dataset_id: 3395.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-13024 contains 5,000 chemical compounds with their associated mutagenicity activities. Each compound is described by 41 molecular descriptors, such as atom counts, bond counts, and electronic properties. The mutagenicity activity is represented by a binary variable indicating whether the compound is mutagenic or non-mutagenic. The dataset serves as a training set for modeling and predicting the mutagenicity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. It can be useful in the development of new drugs and chemicals by identifying potential mutagenic compounds and aiding in the design of safer alternatives.
