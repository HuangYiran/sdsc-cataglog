name: QSAR-TID-246
dataset_id: 3349.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-246 contains 246 compounds with their respective binary bioconcentration factors (BCF). The compounds are classified based on their physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight and hydrogen bond donor count. The BCF values range from low to high, indicating varying degrees of bioconcentration potential. The dataset also includes descriptors like atomic compositions and electronic properties for each compound. QSAR modeling techniques can be applied to this dataset to predict the BCF values for new compounds, aiding in the evaluation of their bioconcentration potential. The dataset is publicly available and can be utilized for research purposes.
