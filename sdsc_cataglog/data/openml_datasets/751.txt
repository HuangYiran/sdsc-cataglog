name: ecoli
dataset_id: 1011.0
description: The dataset ecoli contains information about the structure and biological activity of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. It includes data on the relative codon adaptation index (RCAI) values, which measures the difference in codon usage between different organisms. The dataset also provides information about the occurrence of specific amino acids and residue accessibilities in E. coli proteins. Additionally, it includes data on the stability of proteins and their discriminant scores. The aim of this dataset is to research and understand the relationship between different factors and the bacterial activity of E. coli, aiding in the development of interventions and treatments.
