description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100956 contains information about 1050 compounds and their biological activity against HIV-1. The compounds are represented by 918 molecular descriptors, which are used to predict the biological activity of the compounds. The dataset also includes the activity values, ranging from 0 to 10, that indicate the potency of the compounds against HIV-1. The goal of this dataset is to develop a model that can accurately predict the biological activity of new compounds against HIV-1 based on their molecular descriptors. This dataset can be useful for researchers and scientists working in the field of drug discovery and development for HIV-1.
