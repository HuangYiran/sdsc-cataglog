description: The KDDCup09-Appetency dataset is a dataset used for the KDD Cup 2009 competition. It contains data related to customer behavior and demographics. The dataset consists of more than 2 million instances and 800 variables. The goal of the competition was to predict customer appetency, which is the likelihood of a customer becoming interested in a product based on their behavior. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, with missing values that need to be handled. It also has a class imbalance issue, with a low proportion of positive examples. The dataset has been pre-processed and anonymized to protect customer privacy.
