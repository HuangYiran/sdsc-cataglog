name: QSAR-TID-102840
dataset_id: 3620.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102840 contains molecular descriptors and experimental bioactivity data for a set of compounds. These descriptors include information about the chemical structure and properties of the compounds. The bioactivity data is measured as IC50 values, which represent the concentration required to reach a 50% inhibition of a specific target protein. The dataset aims to support the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the bioactivity of compounds based on their descriptors. QSAR-TID-102840 can be used by researchers in the field of drug discovery and development to design new compounds with desired bioactivity profiles.
