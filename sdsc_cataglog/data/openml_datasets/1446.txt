name: QSAR-TID-10856
dataset_id: 3426.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10856 consists of 751 compounds with their corresponding activities against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The activities are measured through inhibitory concentration (IC50), which is the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the viral replication. The compounds have been classified as active or inactive based on their IC50 values. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, bond counts, and molecular properties. These descriptors are used to predict the activities of new compounds against SARS-CoV, allowing researchers to identify potential antiviral compounds. The dataset is widely used in the field of computational chemistry and drug discovery.
