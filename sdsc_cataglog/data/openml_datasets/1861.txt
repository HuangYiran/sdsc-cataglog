name: QSAR-TID-103780
dataset_id: 3846.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103780 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It contains 1,034 compounds, each represented by 4,329 molecular descriptors. The biological activity of these compounds is measured by IC50 values, which indicate the concentration required for 50% inhibition of a specific enzyme. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models in drug discovery. The compounds in this dataset are diverse, covering a range of chemical structures and activities. It can be used to explore structure-activity relationships and develop predictive models for drug design.
