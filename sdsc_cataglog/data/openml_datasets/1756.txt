name: QSAR-TID-12017
dataset_id: 3739.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12017 is a collection of 185 compounds that were tested to determine their toxicity towards rats. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors like topological, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of the compounds. The rat toxicity was measured using the LD50 metric, which represents the dose required to kill half of the tested population. The dataset also includes information about the molecular structure, formula, and molecular weight of the compounds. QSAR-TID-12017 is a valuable resource for developing predictive models to assess the potential toxicity of new chemical compounds, aiding in the design of safer substances.
