name: QSAR-TID-101602
dataset_id: 3477.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101602 dataset contains information about molecules and their inhibitory activities against dopamine D2 receptor. It consists of 1,602 molecules, each with 228 molecular descriptors. The dataset aims to help in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting inhibitory activities. The target variable is the logarithm of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (logIC50). The dataset provides an opportunity for researchers to investigate the relationships between molecular descriptors and inhibitory activities, and to develop computational models for predicting the inhibitory activities of new molecules against dopamine D2 receptor.
