dataset_id: 42035.0
description: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and statistical analysis. It contains information about the measurements of four different attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different species of iris flowers (namely, setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset has 150 instances, with 50 instances for each species. Its purpose is to demonstrate classification algorithms by predicting the species of an iris flower based on its attributes. The dataset is widely used and easily accessible, making it a popular choice for beginners to learn and practice data analysis and machine learning techniques.
