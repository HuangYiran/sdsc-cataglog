dataset_id: 3406.0
description: QSAR-TID-11870 is a dataset that contains information about the toxicity of molecules. The dataset consists of 169 molecules and includes features such as molecular descriptors, topological indices, and physicochemical properties. The target variable is the toxicity of the molecules, which is evaluated using the FDA acute toxicity categories. The data is divided into training and testing sets, with 135 molecules in the training set and 34 molecules in the testing set. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicity of molecules, which can be useful in drug discovery and environmental risk assessment.
