name: QSAR-TID-11109
dataset_id: 3915.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11109 contains information about chemical compounds and their biological activity. It includes a total of 4,995 samples, each with 1,318 features. The compounds are classified into two categories based on their inhibitory effect on thrombin, an enzyme involved in blood clotting. The dataset is provided in an SDF file format, which contains the structure of each compound along with their corresponding biological activity value. It was created for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the inhibitory activity of similar compounds.
