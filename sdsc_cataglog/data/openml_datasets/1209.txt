name: QSAR-TID-11755
dataset_id: 3185.0
description: QSAR-TID-11755 is a dataset that contains a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding biodegradability values. It consists of 4,000 chemical compounds, represented by 1,071 molecular descriptors. Each descriptor characterizes different aspects of the compounds, such as size, shape, and molecular structure. The biodegradability values range from 0.0 to 1.0, indicating the likelihood of the compounds being biodegradable. The dataset aims to aid in the development and validation of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the biodegradability of chemical compounds. It can be used for various applications in fields related to environmental science and toxicology.
