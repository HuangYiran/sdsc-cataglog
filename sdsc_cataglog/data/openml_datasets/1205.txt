name: QSAR-TID-133
dataset_id: 3181.0
description: QSAR-TID-133 is a dataset containing information on chemical compounds and their biological activities. It consists of 133 samples with 8 molecular descriptors and a target variable expressing the compound's activity as either active or inactive. The dataset explores the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) between the molecular descriptors and the compound's activity. The molecular descriptors include features like bond count, topological indices, and hydrophobicity. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of models to predict a compound's activity based on its molecular properties, which could be valuable in drug discovery and chemical design.
