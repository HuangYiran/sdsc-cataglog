name: QSAR-TID-101199
dataset_id: 3737.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101199 is a collection of chemical compounds with their corresponding inhibitory activity against the thrombin enzyme. The dataset contains 951 instances, each representing a unique chemical compound. Each instance is described by 13 molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight, solubility, and hydrogen bonding capacity. The inhibitory activity of each compound is expressed as a continuous value ranging from 0 to 10. The dataset aims to predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds based on their molecular properties. It is widely used in the field of drug discovery and can be valuable for developing new thrombin inhibitors.
