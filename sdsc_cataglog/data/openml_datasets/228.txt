description: The dataset confidence refers to the level of trust and reliability placed on a particular dataset. It indicates the degree to which the data is accurate, complete, and consistent. Dataset confidence can be influenced by various factors such as the data source, data quality, data validation processes, and the expertise of the individuals involved in collecting and curating the dataset. High dataset confidence ensures that the information derived from the dataset is trustworthy and can be used confidently for analysis and decision-making purposes. Conversely, low dataset confidence raises concerns about the data's integrity and may require additional validation or verification steps before its application.
