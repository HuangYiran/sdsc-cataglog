description: The dataset compass is a tool used in the criminal justice system to predict likelihood of reoffending. It uses various factors such as age, criminal history, and previous convictions to assign individuals a risk score. The accuracy and fairness of this dataset have been questioned, as it has been found to disproportionately impact certain groups. Critics argue that using past data to predict future behavior perpetuates biases and inequalities in the criminal justice system. Research has shown that black defendants are more likely to be assigned higher risk scores compared to white defendants with similar backgrounds. This has led to concerns about the dataset being used to make decisions that can have significant consequences for individuals' lives.
