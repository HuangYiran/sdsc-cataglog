name: QSAR-TID-197
dataset_id: 3153.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-197, available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains information about the biological activity of a set of compounds. It consists of 197 instances, each characterized by 8 molecular descriptors and a target variable measuring the experimental IC50 value. The IC50 value represents the concentration of a compound required to inhibit the enzymatic activity of a specific target protein by 50%. The molecular descriptors capture various properties of the compounds, such as their size, shape, and electronic structure. Researchers can use this dataset to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the biological activity of similar compounds.
