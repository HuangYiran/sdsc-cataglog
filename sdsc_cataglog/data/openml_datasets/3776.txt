name: SGEMM_GPU_kernel_performance
dataset_id: 43871.0
description: The dataset "SGEMM_GPU_kernel_performance" contains performance measurement data of a GPU kernel for a dense linear algebra operation known as Single-Precision General Matrix Multiply. The dataset includes various attributes such as the runtime input size, the number of attributes, the number of registers used, and the L1 and L2 cache sizes utilized during the computation. The dataset also provides information on the number of shared and global memory loads and stores, and the execution time of the kernel. The data is aimed at helping researchers and developers analyze and optimize GPU kernel performance for linear algebra operations.
