name: Primary-breast-cancer-vs-Normal-breast-tissue
dataset_id: 43727.0
description: The dataset "Primary-breast-cancer-vs-Normal-breast-tissue" contains data related to classifying primary breast cancer tissue samples versus normal breast tissue samples. The dataset includes information on gene expression levels of various genes and categorizes the samples accordingly. It also provides additional information, such as age and menopausal status, for each sample. The dataset aims to help researchers and clinicians study and differentiate between primary breast cancer and normal breast tissue. It can potentially be used in developing machine learning models for accurate classification and further understanding the molecular differences between these two types of breast tissue.
