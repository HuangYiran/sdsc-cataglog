dataset_id: 45550.0
description: The ATLAS Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge was conducted in 2014 as a part of the Higgs boson discovery. The dataset contains characteristics generated by a simulation of particle collisions to help classify events in data collected from the ATLAS detector at CERN. The main goal of this challenge was to develop machine learning models that could accurately distinguish between events with or without a Higgs boson. The dataset consists of 250,000 labeled examples with a variety of features, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms for this classification task.
