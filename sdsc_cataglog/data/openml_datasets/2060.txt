name: QSAR-TID-12955
dataset_id: 4046.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12955 dataset is a collection of molecular descriptors generated for a set of chemical compounds. These descriptors are numerical values that represent various physical and chemical properties of the molecules. The dataset also includes binary classification labels indicating whether each compound is active or inactive against a specific target. It was created for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which aim to predict the bioactivity of molecules based on their structural features. The dataset contains 1280 instances, with 101 molecular descriptors and the binary classification target variable. It can be utilized for machine learning and statistical analysis in drug discovery and related fields.
