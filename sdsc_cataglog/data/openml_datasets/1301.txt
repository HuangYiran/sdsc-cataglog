name: QSAR-TID-10980
dataset_id: 3277.0
description: QSAR-TID-10980 is a dataset that comprises information about 457 compounds and their activities against a protein target. The dataset consists of 44 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values representing the physicochemical properties of the compounds. The target variable is the activity of the compounds, measured as an IC50 value. The dataset also includes information about the classification of the compounds into two classes, active and inactive. The goal of this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the activity of compounds against the target protein. It is a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and molecular modeling.
