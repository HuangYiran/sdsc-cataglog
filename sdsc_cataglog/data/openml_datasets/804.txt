name: qqdefects_numeric
dataset_id: 1072.0
description: The dataset qqdefects_numeric represents a collection of numeric attributes from a software defect data set. It contains 18 attributes including those related to the software's complexity, size, and defects. The data was collected from a software development project, and it includes information from multiple releases. The attributes have been pre-processed and transformed into numerical values to aid in analysis and modeling. This dataset can be used to explore the relationship between various attributes and defects, and to develop predictive models to estimate the defect counts in software projects. Overall, qqdefects_numeric provides a valuable resource for studying software defects and improving software development processes.
