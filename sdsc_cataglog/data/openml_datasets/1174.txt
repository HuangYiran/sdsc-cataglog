name: QSAR-TID-101231
dataset_id: 3150.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101231 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It contains 1,123 samples with 828 positive and 295 negative examples. Each sample is represented by 41 molecular descriptors that capture the chemical characteristics of the compound. These descriptors are based on structural and physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, connectivity indices, and electronic effects. The dataset aims to provide information that can be used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. QSAR-TID-101231 is publicly available and has been extensively used in research for developing machine learning algorithms for drug discovery and toxicity prediction.
