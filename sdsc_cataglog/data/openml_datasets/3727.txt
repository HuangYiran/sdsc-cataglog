name: MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Dataset
dataset_id: 43804.0
description: The MAGIC-Gamma-Telescope-Dataset is a collection of data related to gamma-ray emissions detected by the MAGIC gamma-ray telescope. It consists of information on 19,020 instances and 11 attributes, including measurements related to the shape and distribution of the electromagnetic shower induced by gamma rays. The dataset was contributed by the Institute of Computer Science at the University of Sao Paulo and made available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is often used for classification tasks to distinguish gamma rays from cosmic rays. The dataset aims to facilitate research and development of machine learning algorithms in high-energy astrophysics.
