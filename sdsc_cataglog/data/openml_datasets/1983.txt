name: QSAR-TID-12568
dataset_id: 3969.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12568 is related to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the toxicity of compounds. The dataset contains 474 chemical compounds characterized by various molecular descriptors. These descriptors are based on atom-centered fragments, connectivity indices, and other topological features. The toxicity values of the compounds are given in terms of LD50 (median lethal dose) values. The dataset aims to help develop predictive models for toxicity assessment and aid in the identification of potentially harmful compounds. It provides valuable information for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and chemical safety.
