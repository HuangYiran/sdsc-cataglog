description: The dataset slump refers to a phenomenon where datasets become less effective at generating meaningful insights. This can occur due to various reasons. One reason is data redundancy, where a dataset contains repetitive or duplicate information. Another reason is data incompleteness, where important variables or observations are missing. Additionally, data inconsistency can occur when there are discrepancies or contradictions in the dataset. Poor data quality and outdated data can also contribute to the dataset slump. To ensure the dataset's usefulness and accuracy, it is crucial to address these issues and maintain data integrity through regular updates, proper cleansing, and validation procedures.
