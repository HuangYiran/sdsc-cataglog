name: airfoil_self_noise
dataset_id: 44957.0
description: The airfoil_self_noise dataset consists of 1,500 data points, each with a set of six features derived from airfoil tests. These features include the airspeed velocity, angle of attack, chord length, free-stream velocity, and the displacement and frequency of the sound pressure level. The target variable is the scaled sound pressure level, obtained from physical experiments. The dataset can be used for regression analysis tasks and modeling the relationship between airfoil characteristics and the sound pressure level it produces. The dataset is suitable for researchers, engineers, and machine learning practitioners interested in aerodynamics and noise prediction in airfoil design.
