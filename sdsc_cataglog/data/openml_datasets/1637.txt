name: QSAR-TID-100872
dataset_id: 3622.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100872 focuses on achieving a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of thiazolidinone derivatives, potentially exhibiting pesticidal activity. The dataset consists of 154 compounds with 41 molecular descriptors, which include both 2D and 3D properties. These descriptors encompass chemical and spatial properties like molecular weight, H-bonding, connectivity indices, topological, and geometrical descriptors. The dataset aims to establish a correlation between the molecular descriptors and the biological activity of compounds, facilitating the identification of potential pesticidal agents. QSAR-TID-100872 contributes to the field of computational chemistry by aiding in the development of more effective and targeted pesticide designs.
