name: AP_Ovary_Lung
dataset_id: 1140.0
description: The dataset AP_Ovary_Lung contains gene expression data from two different types of tissues, namely ovarian and lung tissues. The data provides information about the expression levels of various genes in these tissues. This dataset can be used to study the differences and similarities in gene expression between ovarian and lung tissues, which may help in understanding the underlying genetic factors associated with these tissues. The dataset is likely to be valuable for researchers working in the field of genomics and molecular biology, as it provides a resource for investigating tissue-specific gene expression profiles and potential biomarkers for these tissues.
