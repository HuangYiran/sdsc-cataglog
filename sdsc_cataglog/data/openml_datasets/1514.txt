name: QSAR-TID-115
dataset_id: 3497.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-115 is a collection of 115 chemical compounds that are related to the inhibition of thrombin, an enzyme involved in blood coagulation. These compounds were synthesized and their activities were measured using a fluorescence-based assay. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors like molecular weight, polarizability, and hydration energy, along with the corresponding thrombin inhibition values. The goal of this dataset is to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model, which can effectively predict the thrombin inhibitory activity of new chemical compounds. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and development.
