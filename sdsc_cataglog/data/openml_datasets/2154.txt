name: Smartphone-Based_Recognition_of_Human_Activities
dataset_id: 4153.0
description: The dataset "Smartphone-Based_Recognition_of_Human_Activities" consists of sensor readings captured from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone fused with video recordings. The activities performed by participants include walking, sitting, standing, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, and lying down. The sensor data is collected from a group of 30 volunteers, wearing the smartphone on their waist while performing these activities. The dataset includes a training set and a testing set, with a total of 10,299 instances and 561 features. The goal of this dataset is to develop machine learning models for accurately recognizing and classifying human activities using smartphone-based sensors.
