name: QSAR-TID-10904
dataset_id: 3934.0
description: QSAR-TID-10904 is a dataset that contains molecular descriptors for a set of compounds used in drug discovery and development. The dataset consists of 10904 instances, each represented by various attributes such as topological, geometric, and electronic properties. These properties are derived from the chemical formula of the compounds and are used to predict their biological activity. The dataset is particularly focused on predicting the acute oral toxicity of the compounds, which is an important factor in determining their safety in pharmaceutical applications. QSAR-TID-10904 serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and understanding the relationship between molecular properties and drug toxicity.
