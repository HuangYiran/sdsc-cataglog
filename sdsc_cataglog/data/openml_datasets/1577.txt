name: QSAR-TID-102733
dataset_id: 3562.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102733 pertains to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of a set of 1027 chemical compounds. It aims to predict the acute aquatic toxicity of these compounds towards Daphnia magna, a small water flea. The compounds are described by 41 molecular descriptors, including topological, geometrical, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical properties. The dataset also provides experimental toxicity values recorded as EC50, which is the concentration required for 50% mortality of organisms after a 48-hour exposure. It serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and understanding the relationships between molecular properties and toxicity towards Daphnia magna.
