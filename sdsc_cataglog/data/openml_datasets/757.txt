description: The arrhythmia dataset is a collection of data related to patients with different types of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms). It contains 279 attributes, including patient demographic information, symptoms, medical test results, and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The dataset also includes a target variable indicating the presence or absence of arrhythmia. The data has been preprocessed and standardized, with missing values imputed. However, there are still several challenges in analyzing this dataset, such as class imbalance, outliers, and high dimensionality. Overall, the arrhythmia dataset provides valuable information for researchers and healthcare professionals studying heart rhythm disorders.
