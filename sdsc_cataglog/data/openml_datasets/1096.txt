name: QSAR-TID-100671
dataset_id: 3072.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100671 contains information related to 1009 chemical compounds and their biological activity values. It includes 180 molecular descriptors and the corresponding values for their toxicity. The compounds have been evaluated for their Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity, which is a common method for determining the potential toxicity of chemicals. The dataset also provides information such as the SMILES notation (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) for each compound, which represents the chemical structure. This dataset can be utilized for developing QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models to predict the toxicity of chemicals based on their molecular descriptors and structures.
