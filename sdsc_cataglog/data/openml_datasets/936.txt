dataset_id: 1458.0
description: The dataset Arcene is a collection of gene expression measurements for two types of cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It contains 10000 samples, with 10000 features (genes), out of which 3000 are informative and 7000 are redundant. The AML class consists of 50 samples and the ALL class contains 50 samples. The dataset aims to predict whether a patient has AML or ALL based on gene expression data. The Arcene dataset is often used for classification purposes and machine learning research in the context of cancer diagnostics and gene expression analysis.
