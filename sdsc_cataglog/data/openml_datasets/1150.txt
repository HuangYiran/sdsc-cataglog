name: QSAR-TID-100416
dataset_id: 3126.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100416 contains information about chemical compounds and their biological activity. It consists of 1055 instances, each with 41 features including structural, thermodynamic, and electronic properties. The objective is to predict the toxicological activity classes of these compounds. The dataset is imbalanced, with the majority of compounds being non-mutagenic. It is suitable for classification and regression analysis tasks. The data has been extensively preprocessed, including removing duplicates and outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This dataset can be used for developing models to predict the mutagenicity of chemical compounds, aiding drug discovery and substance safety assessments.
