name: QSAR-TID-11265
dataset_id: 3249.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11265 contains information on the binding affinity of a series of chemical compounds to thrombin, an enzyme involved in blood clotting. The dataset consists of 286 instances, each having 16 molecular descriptors as features. The goal is to predict the binding affinity of new compounds based on these descriptors. The dataset is widely used in the field of cheminformatics for developing models and algorithms to aid in drug discovery and design. It is freely available for research purposes and can be accessed from the QSAR World website.
