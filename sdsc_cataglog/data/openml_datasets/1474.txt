name: QSAR-TID-270
dataset_id: 3456.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-270 contains 270 samples of organic compounds with their corresponding biological activities. The compounds are represented by 41 molecular descriptors, which are numerical values that quantify their physicochemical properties. These descriptors include molecular weight, number of atoms, and topological indices. The dataset aims to predict the toxicity of the compounds based on their molecular characteristics. It has been extensively used in various quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies to develop predictive models. QSAR-TID-270 is an important resource for researchers and scientists in chemoinformatics and drug discovery to understand and predict the activity and toxicity of organic compounds.
