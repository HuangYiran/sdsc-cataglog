name: QSAR-TID-248
dataset_id: 3752.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-248 is a collection of 248 chemical compounds with their corresponding biological activities. It includes various features such as molecular weight, solubility, and hydrophobicity. The goal of this dataset is to predict the activity levels of new compounds based on these features. The dataset is well-balanced in terms of the number of active and inactive compounds. It has been widely used by researchers in the field of cheminformatics to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the biological activities of chemical compounds.
