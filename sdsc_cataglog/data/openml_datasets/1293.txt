name: QSAR-TID-11142
dataset_id: 3269.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11142 consists of 1134 molecules with multiple features representing their chemical properties. The molecules are divided into two classes, active and inactive, representing their biological activity against a specific target. The dataset includes 1024 molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight, bond counts, and charge density, along with their corresponding activities. The objective of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can classify new molecules into either active or inactive based on their chemical features. It can be used for machine learning and cheminformatics research to understand the relationship between molecular properties and biological activity.
