name: QSAR-TID-12894
dataset_id: 3207.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12894 is a collection of chemical compounds and their associated biological activity values. It consists of 4,934 compounds with both positive and negative activity records. The compounds are represented by 528 molecular descriptors, which provide detailed information about the structure and properties of the compounds. These descriptors include topological, electrostatic, and quantum-chemical properties. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the activity of new compounds based on their descriptors. QSAR-TID-12894 is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of drug discovery and chemical biology.
