description: The dataset "arcene_seed_4_nrows_2000_nclasses_10_ncols_100_stratify_True" contains 2000 rows and 100 columns. It has 10 different classes and is stratified, meaning the class distribution is balanced. This dataset is used for classification tasks. It is named "arcene_seed_4" because it is a variation of the arcene dataset, and "seed_4" indicates that a specific random seed was used for generating the dataset. It is designed to test and evaluate machine learning models and algorithms for classification problems with multiple classes. The dataset's characteristics make it suitable for studying and developing solutions for classification tasks in a stratified setting.
