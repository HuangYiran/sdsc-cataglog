name: QSAR-TID-11149
dataset_id: 3741.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11149 contains information about 1025 chemical compounds and their respective biological activities. It includes 531 active compounds, which cause perturbations in the biological system, and 494 inactive compounds, which do not cause any significant effect. The activities of the compounds are classified into two categories: active and inactive. The dataset comprises various molecular descriptors, such as 3D descriptors, constitutional descriptors, topological descriptors, electronic descriptors, and hybrid descriptors. It also includes the calculated octanol-water partition coefficient, which is an important indicator of the compound's behavior in biological systems. This dataset can be useful for developing predictive models to classify the activity of chemical compounds based on their molecular features.
