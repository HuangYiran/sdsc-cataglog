dataset_id: 3552.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10872 dataset contains 275,338 compounds that are potential ligand-based inhibitors of Bcl-2. It includes compounds with diverse structures, including heterocycles, which have been shown to exhibit anti-apoptotic activity. The dataset is compiled by combining chemical structures from various sources and curating them for the purpose of building accurate quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The compounds in this dataset have been labeled with their inhibitory activity against Bcl-2, enabling researchers to develop predictive models to identify potential inhibitors. This dataset is valuable for understanding the structure-activity relationships of Bcl-2 inhibitors and designing new therapeutic agents.
