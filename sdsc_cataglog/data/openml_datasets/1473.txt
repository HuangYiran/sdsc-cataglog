name: QSAR-TID-100413
dataset_id: 3455.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100413 contains information on several chemical compounds. It includes a total of 1044 compounds, each described by 590 molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide quantitative information about the chemical structure and properties of each compound. The dataset also includes a target variable, designed as IC50, which represents the inhibitory concentration needed to achieve 50% inhibition of a specific target protein. The purpose of this dataset is to aid in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which can predict the inhibitory activity of new compounds based on their molecular descriptors. The dataset can be used to train and evaluate the performance of these models.
