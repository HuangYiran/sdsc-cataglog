name: QSAR-TID-17120
dataset_id: 3221.0
description: QSAR-TID-17120 is a dataset comprising 740 molecular compounds with information related to their biological activity against a specific target. The dataset includes various molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, logP, and the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, among others. The compounds are divided into two classes: active and inactive, based on their biological activity. The dataset also provides information about the experimental conditions under which the activity was measured, including the concentration of the compound. QSAR-TID-17120 can be used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to predict the activity of compounds against the specific target, aiding in the discovery and design of new drugs.
