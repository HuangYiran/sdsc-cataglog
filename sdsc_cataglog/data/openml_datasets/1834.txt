name: QSAR-TID-11288
dataset_id: 3819.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11288 consists of 3,206 compounds with 120 molecular descriptors and a binary attribute indicating their toxicity. The compounds belong to a diverse range of chemical classes and include both active and inactive compounds. The dataset was curated from the ChEMBL database and various literature sources. The molecular descriptors were generated using open-source tools and represent physicochemical properties, topological indices, and electronic properties of the compounds. The binary attribute represents whether the compound is toxic or non-toxic to a specific organism. This dataset is widely used for developing predictive models and exploring the relationship between molecular features and toxicity.
