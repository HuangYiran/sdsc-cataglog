name: subset_higgs
dataset_id: 45645.0
description: The dataset subset_higgs is a subset of the full Higgs dataset, which was created for experimentation and analysis. It contains a high-dimensional vector of features extracted from particle collision events, as well as a binary label indicating the presence of the Higgs boson. The dataset consists of 98050 instances, and a 30% random sample of it was selected as the testing set, while the remaining instances were used for training purposes. The dataset is balanced in terms of the binary label and is useful for tasks such as binary classification and feature selection in high-energy physics.
