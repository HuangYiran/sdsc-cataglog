dataset_id: 3423.0
description: The QSAR-TID-101407 dataset consists of 1414 chemical compounds with 527 molecular descriptors. These descriptors are numerical values that represent a compound's structural, topological, and physicochemical properties. The dataset is primarily focused on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for predicting compounds' toxicity to rats. The compounds were tested in an in vivo assay, and the toxicity levels were measured using the rat's Oral LD50 values (the median lethal dose for 50% of the population). The dataset aims to facilitate the development of reliable computational models for predicting toxicity and aiding in the screening of new chemical compounds.
