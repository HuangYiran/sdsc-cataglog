name: QSAR-TID-168
dataset_id: 3350.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-168 comprises 160 variables obtained from molecular descriptors calculated for a set of 89 organic compounds. The target variable is the pIC50 value, which represents the negative logarithm of the concentration that inhibits 50% of the enzyme thrombin. The dataset was created for the purpose of predicting the activity of potential thrombin inhibitors. The molecular descriptors consist of chemical properties such as bond counts, connectivity indices, and topological indices, which provide insights into the compounds' structure and reactivity. The dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to aid in drug discovery and design.
