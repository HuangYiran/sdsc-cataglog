name: QSAR-TID-12965
dataset_id: 3953.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12965 dataset contains information about the toxicity of various chemical compounds. It includes attributes such as molecular weight, solubility, and several other physicochemical features. The dataset has 8,740 instances and 1,029 variables. The target variable represents the toxicity endpoint of the compounds on a binary scale. The dataset is suitable for building models for binary classification tasks related to toxicity prediction. It was collected for the purpose of developing and evaluating quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The availability of this dataset enables researchers and data scientists to explore and develop new methods for toxicity prediction and risk assessment in the field of chemistry.
