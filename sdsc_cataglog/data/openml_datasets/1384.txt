name: QSAR-TID-103071
dataset_id: 3361.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103071 contains 403 highly diverse chemical compounds used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models. The compounds are characterized by 122 molecular descriptors, which are numerical representations of their chemical structure and properties. The dataset also includes the experimental activity values of these compounds against a specific target protein, providing information on their biological activity. This dataset aims to aid in the prediction of the binding affinity of these compounds to the target protein, crucial in drug design and development. The dataset's diverse compounds and molecular descriptors make it valuable for QSAR studies and computational modeling.
