name: QSAR-TID-103101
dataset_id: 3244.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103101 consists of 682 chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. The compounds were obtained from the PubChem database and their activities were determined using various bioassay experiments. Each compound is represented by 2D molecular descriptors such as atom counts, bond counts, and topological indices. The biological activities of each compound were measured as IC50 values, which represent the concentration required to inhibit 50% of a target enzyme's activity. The dataset aims to provide information on the relationship between the chemical structure of compounds and their biological activities, which can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models.
