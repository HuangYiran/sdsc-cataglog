description: The dataset compass is a public dataset that includes information about criminal defendants in the United States. It contains data on over 100,000 defendants and is intended to provide insights into the criminal justice system. The dataset includes information such as demographics, prior criminal history, and risk assessment scores. It also includes information about the outcomes of the cases, such as whether the defendant was released on bail or held in custody. However, there are concerns about the accuracy and fairness of the data, as the risk assessment scores have been found to have biases against people of color.
