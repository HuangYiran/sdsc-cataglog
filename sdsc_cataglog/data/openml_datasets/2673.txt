name: GTSRB-HueHist
dataset_id: 41990.0
description: The dataset GTSRB-HueHist is built for the purpose of traffic sign classification using color histograms. It contains RGB images of traffic signs divided into 43 classes. The dataset consists of two parts: a training set that contains 39,209 fully annotated images and a test set with 12,630 images. Each image is stored as a 32x32 grayscale pixel matrix and the color histogram is calculated using 8 equally spaced bins. This dataset provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating traffic sign detection and classification algorithms based on color information.
