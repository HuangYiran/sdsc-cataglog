name: QSAR-TID-10473
dataset_id: 4120.0
description: The QSAR-TID-10473 dataset contains information about various molecules with their respective properties and activity against a specific target. It consists of 105 compounds with 11 numerical descriptors that represent molecular properties and potency values measuring the activity towards the target. The dataset was created to explore quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in drug discovery. It is publicly available and can be used for developing computational models to predict the potency of new molecules against the target. The dataset is valuable for researchers and scientists in the field of drug design and virtual screening.
