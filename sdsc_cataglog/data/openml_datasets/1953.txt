name: QSAR-TID-101030
dataset_id: 3938.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101030 consists of a total of 850 compounds, each represented by 1024 molecular descriptors. The dataset was initially created to predict the toxicity of chemicals, specifically for the identification of compounds that mimic a test compound's ability to disrupt the endocrine system. The dataset includes information about various molecular features such as shape, size, hydrophobicity, electronic distribution, and more. The chemical structures were represented using simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) notation. The dataset is widely used for developing predictive models and understanding the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) in the context of endocrine disruption.
