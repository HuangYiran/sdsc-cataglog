name: QSAR-TID-101252
dataset_id: 3362.0
description: QSAR-TID-101252 is a dataset containing molecular descriptors and quantitative measures of toxicity for a set of compounds. It consists of 4,528 compounds, each described by 828 molecular descriptors, resulting in a total of 3,751,584 data points. The dataset aims to facilitate the prediction of toxicity for new chemical compounds based on these molecular descriptors. The toxicity measures were determined experimentally through an in vitro bioassay and are represented by continuous values ranging from -9.04 to 3.58, with lower values indicating higher toxicity. The dataset is publicly accessible and can be used for various toxicological studies and performance evaluation of QSAR models.
