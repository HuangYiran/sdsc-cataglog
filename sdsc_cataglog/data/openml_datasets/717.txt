dataset_id: 977.0
description: The dataset "letter" consists of 20,000 examples of handwritten letters, equally balanced between uppercase and lowercase classes. Each example is a 16x8 image of a letter from the English alphabet, with pixels represented by integer values ranging from 0 (blank) to 15 (black). The letters are divided into three groups: "training" (16,000 examples), "validation" (2,000 examples), and "test" (2,000 examples). The dataset was created for the purpose of training machine learning models to recognize handwriting. The dataset has been used in various studies and competitions, serving as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of different algorithms in letter recognition tasks.
