description: The dataset SVHN (Street View House Numbers) is a large-scale dataset for recognizing digits in natural scene images. It contains over 600,000 labeled images of house numbers collected from Google Street View. The dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and test. The images are in RGB format and have varying sizes, with each image labeled by a bounding box indicating the locations of individual digits. The dataset provides a challenging task for digit recognition due to occlusion, clutter, and tightly cropped digits. SVHN has been widely used for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms for character recognition.
