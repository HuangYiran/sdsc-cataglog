dataset_id: 42091.0
description: The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in statistics, machine learning, and data science. It consists of measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three different species of iris flowers. The dataset contains a total of 150 observations, with 50 samples from each species. It is often used as a benchmark dataset for classification algorithms due to its simplicity and well-defined classes. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements. The dataset is freely available and widely used for educational and research purposes in the field of data analysis.
