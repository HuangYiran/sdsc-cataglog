name: QSAR-TID-10878
dataset_id: 3046.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10878 contains 1058 chemical compounds and their corresponding toxicity values. The compounds are represented by various molecular descriptors, including constitutional, topological, physical, chemical, and electronic properties. The toxicity values are expressed as a LogLD50 (mammalian oral toxicity), which indicates the lethal dose necessary to kill half of the tested animals. This dataset was created for the development and evaluation of new mathematical models and machine learning algorithms to predict the toxicity of chemical compounds. It offers a valuable resource for researchers in the field of chemoinformatics and can contribute to advancements in drug development and toxicology studies.
