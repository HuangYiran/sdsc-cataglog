name: QSAR-TID-102734
dataset_id: 3524.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-102734 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. The main purpose of this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. It contains 2039 instances and 68 attributes, including 1 target variable and 67 molecular descriptors. The target variable represents the biological activity of the compounds, which is measured using a logarithmic scale. The descriptors provide information about the molecular structure and properties of the compounds. This dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, such as classification and regression, in the field of chemical informatics.
