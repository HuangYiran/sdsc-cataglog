name: QSAR-TID-11006
dataset_id: 3619.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11006 contains information about the inhibitory activity of chemical compounds against a specific enzyme. It consists of 11 input variables and 1 output variable, which represents the inhibitory constant (log IC50). The dataset includes 1055 instances. The input variables are derived from the molecular structure of the compounds and include features such as molecular weight, atomic composition, and topological indices. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of models for predicting the inhibitory activity of new compounds against the enzyme, which can be useful in drug discovery and development processes. Overall, the dataset provides valuable information for understanding the relationship between the chemical structure and inhibitory activity.
