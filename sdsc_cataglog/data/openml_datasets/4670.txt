description: HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) is a dataset that focuses on credit card balance and delinquency. It contains information on 10,000 HELOC borrowers and their credit features. The dataset includes variables such as utilization ratios, credit history information, delinquency patterns, credit scores, and demographic information, among others. HELOC borrowers are classified based on their delinquency status, with categories ranging from "No Delinquency" to "Derogatory Remarks" indicating severe delinquency. The dataset is used to analyze and predict borrower delinquency behavior, exploring the relationship between various credit features and delinquency risk. This dataset is valuable for both lenders and researchers to understand credit card delinquency patterns and develop effective risk management strategies.
