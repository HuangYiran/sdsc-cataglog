description: The dataset "Contaminant-detection-in-packaged-cocoa-hazelnut-spread-jars-using-Microwaves-Sensing-and-Machine-Learning-10.5GHz" by Urbinati focuses on detecting contaminants in packaged cocoa hazelnut spread jars using microwaves sensing and machine learning. The dataset includes measurements of microwave scattering parameters obtained from different jars, some containing contaminants, while others do not. The purpose of the study is to develop an accurate and reliable method for contaminant detection in food products using microwave technology. This dataset can be used for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms to identify and classify contaminants in packaged food items.
