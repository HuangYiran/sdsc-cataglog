name: QSAR-TID-30031
dataset_id: 3868.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30031 consists of 4105 observations and 1024 molecular descriptors. It was created for a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study to predict the acute oral toxicity of chemicals. The target variable is the log LD50 value, which represents the toxicological dose required to cause death in 50% of a population. The descriptors include various molecular properties such as topological, electrostatic, and quantum chemical features. The dataset aims to aid in the development of computational models for toxicity prediction, which can be valuable in drug discovery and regulatory decision-making processes.
