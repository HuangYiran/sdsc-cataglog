name: QSAR-TID-101211
dataset_id: 4089.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101211 is used for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. It contains 1,012 chemical compounds, each represented by 536 molecular descriptors. The objective of this dataset is to predict the aquatic toxicity of these compounds, which is measured as the concentration at which half of the organisms in the test population die (LC50). The dataset also includes the experimental LC50 values for each compound. This dataset is widely used in the field of toxicology for developing predictive models and assessing the potential toxicity of new chemical compounds.
