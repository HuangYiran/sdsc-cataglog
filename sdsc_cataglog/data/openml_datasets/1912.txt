name: QSAR-TID-10360
dataset_id: 3897.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10360 is a collection of chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activities. It consists of 10,360 instances of 1024 molecular descriptors and a binary response variable indicating whether the compounds are active or inactive. The molecular descriptors provide information about the structure and properties of the compounds, allowing for the prediction of their activity. The dataset is widely used in the field of cheminformatics for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. It offers an opportunity for researchers to explore and analyze the relationship between molecular features and biological activities, enabling the development of new drugs and therapeutic agents.
