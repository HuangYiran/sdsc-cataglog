name: cpu_act
dataset_id: 573.0
description: The dataset called cpu_act contains measurements collected from a power meter while running CPU-intensive tasks on a computer system. The measurements include the power consumption, CPU utilization, and the temperature of the CPU. The dataset consists of 8192 samples with 3 input metrics and 1 output metric. The input metrics include the CPU utilization percentage, the system load average, and the CPU temperature. The output metric is the power consumption in Watts. This dataset can be used for studying and developing models to predict the power consumption of a CPU based on its utilization, temperature, and other factors.
