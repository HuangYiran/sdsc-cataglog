name: andes_9
dataset_id: 45217.0
description: The dataset andes_9 contains information about 190 sediment samples collected from nine lakes in the Andes Mountains. It provides key variables such as depth, age, and various chemical parameters, including carbon and nitrogen content. The data was gathered using sediment cores, which were then analyzed in the lab for different parameters. The purpose of this dataset is to study lake sediment dynamics and nutrient cycling in the Andes. Additionally, it aims to investigate the effects of climate change on these processes. This dataset provides valuable information for researchers studying the environmental changes and ecosystem functioning of high-altitude lakes in the Andes.
