name: QSAR-TID-11441
dataset_id: 3429.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11441 focuses on the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the acute aquatic toxicity of 53 organic compounds. The dataset provides information on both structural and physicochemical properties of the compounds, along with their corresponding experimental toxicity values. The goal is to utilize this data for building models that can accurately predict the toxicity levels of new compounds. The dataset also includes descriptors such as molar refractivity, polarizability, and logP, which describe important characteristics of the compounds. Overall, QSAR-TID-11441 aims to assist in the development of environmentally friendly compounds by providing a means to assess their toxicity.
