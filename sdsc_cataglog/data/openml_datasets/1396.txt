name: QSAR-TID-11085
dataset_id: 3375.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11085 contains information about the activity of chemical compounds against a specific target. It consists of 3,097 instances with 10 input features and one output label. The input features include topological and geometrical descriptors as well as quantum chemical descriptors. The output label represents the biological activity of the compounds and is represented by the IC50 value, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of the target. The dataset can be used to develop models for predicting the activity of compounds and understanding the relationship between their chemical properties and biological activity.
