name: QSAR-TID-100071
dataset_id: 3668.0
description: QSAR-TID-100071 is a dataset used in quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies. It contains 721 compounds, along with their physicochemical properties and biological activities. The dataset is aimed at predicting the potential toxicity of these compounds. The compounds are classified into two categories: active and inactive, based on their activity against the target biomolecule. The dataset includes various descriptors such as molecular weight, polarizability, hydrophobicity, and electronic properties. QSAR-TID-100071 is a valuable resource for developing models to predict the toxicological properties of new compounds and could contribute to the design of safer drugs with fewer side effects.
