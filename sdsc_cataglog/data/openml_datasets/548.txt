name: delta_ailerons
dataset_id: 803.0
description: The dataset delta_ailerons contains data collected from an aircraft's ailerons, which are control surfaces responsible for controlling the aircraft's roll. The data was collected during simulated flights and includes various inputs and corresponding outputs. The inputs include elevator angle, roll angle, pitch angle, and others, while the outputs represent the ailerons' effectiveness. The dataset aims to understand the relationship between the ailerons' position and the resulting roll. It also includes features like time stamp, roll acceleration, and crosswind velocity. The dataset is valuable for studying aileron control and can be used for developing and evaluating models or algorithms related to aircraft control systems.
