name: mnist_784
dataset_id: 554.0
description: The mnist_784 dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and specifically computer vision tasks. It consists of handwritten digit images, each of which is 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset contains 70,000 samples, split into 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each image is grayscale, meaning it has only one channel, and the pixel values range from 0 to 255. The dataset is commonly used for tasks like image classification, digit recognition, and deep learning model development. It is easily accessible and serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating and comparing different machine learning algorithms.
