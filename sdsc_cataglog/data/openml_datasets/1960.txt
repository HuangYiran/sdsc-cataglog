name: QSAR-TID-10495
dataset_id: 3945.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10495 contains quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data for a group of chemical compounds. It includes information on the chemical structure and activity of each compound, as well as various physicochemical properties. The dataset aims to predict the potential toxicity of these compounds based on their structural features. It is based on the principle that compounds with similar structures tend to have similar toxic effects. The data has been collected from various sources and curated for this study. The dataset is useful for researchers working in the field of drug discovery and toxicology to develop new and safer chemical compounds.
