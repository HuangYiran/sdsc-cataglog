name: QSAR-TID-12038
dataset_id: 3957.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12038 dataset is comprised of 11,020 instances with 497 attributes. It belongs to the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, which aims to establish a correlation between the chemical structure of compounds and their biological activity. The dataset contains physicochemical descriptors, including constitutional, topological, electronic, and geometric attributes, as well as information about the mutagenicity of compounds. Categorical attributes are transformed into binary values, while missing attribute values are left as gaps. The dataset was created using computer simulations and experimental measurement techniques. It serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models for mutagenicity.
