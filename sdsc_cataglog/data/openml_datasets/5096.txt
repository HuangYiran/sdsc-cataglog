description: The dataset "prostate" consists of clinical measures and histopathological observations from a study on prostate cancer conducted at the Ohio State University. The study included 97 patients who were about to undergo a radical prostatectomy. The dataset comprises information on individual medical characteristics such as age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, tumor volume, capsular penetration, and surgical margins. Additionally, it includes variables indicating the presence or absence of specific types of cancer cells observed during the histopathological examination. The goal of collecting this data was to investigate the relationship between these clinical and histopathological measures and the progression of prostate cancer, ultimately improving patient outcome prediction.
