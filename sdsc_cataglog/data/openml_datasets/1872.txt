name: QSAR-TID-10617
dataset_id: 3857.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10617 contains information about various chemical compounds and their corresponding biological activity levels. The compounds were tested for their toxicity against a specific organism. The dataset includes 41 different features or descriptors, such as molecular properties, calculated from the chemical structure of the compounds. The challenge is to predict the biological activity level of a compound based on these features. The dataset consists of 562 compounds, with the activity level ranging from 0 to 3. The objective is to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying compounds with potential toxicity.
