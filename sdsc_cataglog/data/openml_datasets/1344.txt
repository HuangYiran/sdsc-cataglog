name: QSAR-TID-101411
dataset_id: 3321.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101411 consists of 960 chemical compounds with their corresponding 41 quantitative molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide information on the molecular structure, size, shape, and the presence of functional groups in the compounds. Each compound is also labeled with its target biological activity, indicating whether it demonstrates inhibitory or non-inhibitory behavior towards thrombin, a proteolytic enzyme involved in blood clotting. The dataset was curated for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of new compounds. It can be utilized for various machine learning and statistical modeling approaches in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry research.
