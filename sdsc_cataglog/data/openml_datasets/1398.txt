name: QSAR-TID-101585
dataset_id: 3377.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101585 consists of 1055 instances with 25 features and one target variable. It was created for predicting the toxicological effects of a compound on Vibrio fischeri bacteria. The features include molecular descriptors, physicochemical properties, and topological indices. The target variable represents the inhibition concentration (IC50) of the compound on the bacteria. The dataset was derived from the PubChem and ChEMBL databases and preprocessed by filtering and removing duplicates. The aim is to develop a QSAR model to accurately predict the toxicological properties of new compounds in order to aid in drug development and risk assessment.
