name: 2dplanes
dataset_id: 215.0
description: The dataset 2dplanes consists of 2D images representing different types of airplane shapes. Each image is described by 128 numerical attributes extracted from it. The dataset contains a total of 1370 examples, with some variations in lighting conditions and angles of the airplanes. The purpose of this dataset is to evaluate and develop classification techniques for shape recognition. It is commonly used in machine learning research to apply algorithms and models to classify the images accurately. The dataset's attributes make it suitable for feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The dataset is publicly available and widely used in the field of image classification and pattern recognition.
