dataset_id: 3145.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12067 dataset is a collection of curated compounds with biological activities against tuberculosis (TB). The dataset contains 2D and 3D descriptors for each compound, including molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and topological descriptors. The compounds were divided into two classes: active and inactive, based on their activity against TB. The dataset aims to provide a reliable resource for developing models that can predict the biological activity of new compounds against TB. It can be used for virtual screening, lead optimization, and drug discovery research in the field of anti-TB drug development.
