name: QSAR-TID-10926
dataset_id: 4011.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10926 contains information on 10,926 chemical compounds. It includes 1024 binary attributes and a continuous attribute representing the biological activity of the compounds. The dataset aims to predict the potential of the chemical compounds to be mutagenic based on these attributes. The binary attributes indicate the presence or absence of certain chemical substructures in the compounds, while the continuous attribute represents the probability of mutagenicity. The dataset has been used in various studies to develop machine learning models for predicting the toxicity of chemical compounds, particularly their mutagenic potential.
