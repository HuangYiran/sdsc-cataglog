description: QSAR-TID-101548 is a dataset containing chemicals classified as inhibitors of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). It consists of 195 molecules with 26 molecular descriptors, including physicochemical, constitutional, and topological properties. The dataset aims to assist in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, which predict the bioactivity of new chemical compounds based on their structural features. The bioactivities of the molecules are measured as the inhibition concentration (IC50), representing the concentration required to inhibit PTP1B by 50%. This dataset is valuable for researchers working on the discovery of new molecules with potential therapeutic applications targeting PTP1B.
