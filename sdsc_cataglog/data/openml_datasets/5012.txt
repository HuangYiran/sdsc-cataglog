description: The dataset "Contaminant-detection-in-packaged-cocoa-hazelnut-spread-jars-using-Microwaves-Sensing-and-Machine-Learning-11.0GHz" by Urbinati focuses on detecting contaminants in packaged cocoa hazelnut spread jars using microwave sensing and machine learning techniques. The data includes measurements of electromagnetic reflected signals obtained from spread jars with various levels of contamination. It also contains corresponding labels indicating the presence of contamination. The dataset aims to facilitate research in detecting contaminants in food products using non-destructive sensing methods and machine learning algorithms. The dataset provides a valuable resource for developing automated systems for quality control in food manufacturing.
