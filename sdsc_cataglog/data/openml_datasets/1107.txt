name: QSAR-TID-103169
dataset_id: 3083.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103169 contains information about the biological activity of compounds towards a specific enzyme target. It consists of 1,283 molecules, each characterized by 41 different properties, such as molecular weight, solubility, and polarity. The compounds are categorized into two classes: active or inactive. The aim is to establish a relationship between the molecular properties and the activity of the compounds using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. This dataset can be valuable for researchers in drug discovery and computational chemistry, as it provides a basis for developing models to predict the activity of new compounds.
