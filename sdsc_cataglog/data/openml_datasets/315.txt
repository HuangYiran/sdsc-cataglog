description: The dataset kdd_el_nino-small comprises oceanographic data collected from various sources between 1980 and 1990. The purpose of this dataset is to understand the El Nino phenomenon, which is a recurrent weather pattern that affects the equatorial Pacific region. The dataset contains information about sea surface temperature, wind speed and direction, air temperature, and rainfall. It also includes data from different regions within the Pacific Ocean, such as Ni単o 1+2, Ni単o 3, Ni単o 3.4, and Ni単o 4. This dataset serves as a resource for studying the relationships between the oceanic and atmospheric variables involved in El Nino events.
