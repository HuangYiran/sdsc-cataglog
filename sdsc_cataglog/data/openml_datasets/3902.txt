name: QSAR_fish_toxycity
dataset_id: 44028.0
description: The QSAR_fish_toxicity dataset contains features and target variables related to the toxicity of organic compounds towards fish. It includes 908 compounds and each compound has 6 descriptors and a binary target variable indicating its toxicity. The dataset aims to predict whether a compound is toxic or non-toxic towards fish based on its descriptors. As for the descriptors, they mainly describe the structural and compositional properties of the compounds. This dataset is commonly used in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling to develop models for predicting the toxicity of new compounds towards fish.
