name: qsar
dataset_id: 45077.0
description: The dataset "qsar" contains information about the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of different compounds. It consists of 1024 instances and 1025 attributes, including the target variable. The target variable represents the biological activity of the compounds. The dataset is publicly available and widely used for research in the field of chemoinformatics and computational chemistry. It has been used to develop predictive models that can estimate the biological activity of new compounds based on their structural features. The dataset is significant for researchers and scientists working on drug design and development, as it aids in understanding the relationship between molecular structures and their biological effects.
