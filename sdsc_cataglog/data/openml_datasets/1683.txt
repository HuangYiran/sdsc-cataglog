name: QSAR-TID-10971
dataset_id: 3666.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10971 contains information on the activity of chemical compounds against a specific target. It consists of 1,091 compounds with 203 molecular descriptors. The target variable is a continuous value representing the biological activity, which was determined experimentally. The descriptors include both 2D and 3D structural features of the compounds. The dataset also provides information about the physicochemical properties of the compounds. The purpose of this dataset is to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict the activity of new chemical compounds against the given target. The dataset can be used for training and testing machine learning algorithms in the field of drug discovery.
