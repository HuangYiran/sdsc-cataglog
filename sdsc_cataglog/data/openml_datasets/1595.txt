name: QSAR-TID-103140
dataset_id: 3580.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-103140 contains information about 1,034 chemicals. It was created to develop predictive models for the toxicity of chemicals towards Tetrahymena pyriformis. The dataset includes 1024 features, which are molecular descriptors representing the compounds' chemical properties. These features were derived from the SMILES notation of the compounds using Dragon software. The toxicity values of the chemicals were quantified in terms of log transformed growth rate inhibition (GR value). This dataset is useful for researchers and experts in the field of toxicology and can be used for developing predictive models and analyzing the relationship between molecular descriptors and toxicity values.
