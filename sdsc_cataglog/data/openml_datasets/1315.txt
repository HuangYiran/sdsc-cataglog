name: QSAR-TID-12887
dataset_id: 3291.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12887 dataset contains information on the biological activity of compounds against a specific target. It involves 1500 compounds and 4 features, namely the molecular weight, a topological parameter, an indicator for the presence of certain functional groups, and a physicochemical property. The target variable represents the biological activity, with a binary classification indicating either active or inactive compounds. The dataset was created using a combination of computational tools and experimental testing. It can be used for the development and evaluation of machine learning models for predicting the biological activity of new compounds.
