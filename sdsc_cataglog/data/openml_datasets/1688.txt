name: QSAR-TID-30042
dataset_id: 3671.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-30042 contains information about the mutagenic activity of various compounds. It consists of 4,285 observations and 8 input variables. These variables include molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, topological descriptors, electrostatic energy, and others. The target variable is the mutagenic activity, which is binary and indicates whether a compound is mutagenic or non-mutagenic. The dataset aims to aid in the development of predictive models for identifying mutagenic compounds. It is publicly available and can be used for research in the field of toxicology and drug discovery.
