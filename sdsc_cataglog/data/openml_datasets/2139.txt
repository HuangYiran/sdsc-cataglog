name: QSAR-TID-11784
dataset_id: 4125.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11784 contains 470 substances with available toxicity data. It aims to predict the toxicity of new chemical compounds using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The toxicity data is measured using the EC50 value, which represents the concentration of a chemical required to inhibit a certain biological activity by 50%. The dataset provides various physicochemical properties of the substances, along with their molecular descriptors. The molecular descriptors are calculated using Dragon software, which computes over 5,000 molecular descriptors. The dataset also includes the experimental class and the predicted toxicity class for each substance, allowing for the evaluation and comparison of various QSAR models.
