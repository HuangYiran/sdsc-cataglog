name: ECG5000
dataset_id: 44793.0
description: The ECG5000 dataset contains a collection of 5,000 electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Each recording consists of 1,400 data points, with a sampling rate of 1kHz. The dataset is labeled with five different classes: Normal, R-on-T beat, atrial premature contraction, premature ventricular contraction, and fusion beat. Each class has 1,000 instances, creating a balanced dataset. The dataset offers a benchmark for evaluating ECG classification algorithms and signal processing techniques. It aims to address the challenges associated with classification and detection of abnormal ECG patterns for diagnostic purposes. The dataset can be used for research in cardiac arrhythmia detection and classification.
