dataset_id: 298.0
description: The dataset "coil2000" is a collection of grayscale images of 2,000 different objects, each belonging to one of 100 categories. Each image is 32x32 pixels in size and is represented as a matrix of values between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of each pixel. The dataset is commonly used for object recognition and classification tasks in computer vision. It is a challenging dataset as the objects have different orientations and appearances, making it a suitable benchmark for evaluating algorithms in this field.
