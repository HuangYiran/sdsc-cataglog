dataset_id: 45502.0
description: The dataset timing-attack-dataset-20-micro-seconds-delay-2022-09-18 is a collection of data that pertains to timing attacks. These attacks exploit the variation in execution time of cryptographic operations to infer sensitive information. The dataset contains information specifically related to timing attacks that involve a 20-microseconds delay. It is expected to be available on September 18th, 2022. Timing attacks are a type of side-channel attack and are often used to compromise the security of systems with vulnerable cryptographic implementations. Researchers and practitioners in the field of cybersecurity may find this dataset useful for studying and developing countermeasures against timing attacks.
