name: QSAR-TID-101399
dataset_id: 3506.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-101399 contains information on the biological activity of various compounds. The compounds are evaluated for their ability to inhibit thrombin, an enzyme involved in the clotting of blood. The dataset includes 642 compounds, with each compound represented by several molecular descriptors. These descriptors provide information on the structure and properties of the compounds. The biological activity of each compound is measured using a classification system in which compounds are classified as either active or inactive. The dataset can be used to develop predictive models to identify potential inhibitors of thrombin based on their molecular properties.
