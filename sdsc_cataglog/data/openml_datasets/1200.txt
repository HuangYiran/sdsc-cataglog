name: QSAR-TID-100871
dataset_id: 3176.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100871 contains information about the structural and electrochemical properties of a set of organic molecules. It includes 712 compounds, with each compound having 49 molecular descriptors. The data was obtained using Density Functional Theory calculations. The aim of this dataset is to predict the critical temperature (Tc) of the superconducting phase transition in these organic compounds. The Tc values range from 3.94 to 185.00 Kelvin. This dataset can be used for developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and machine learning algorithms to predict the superconducting behavior of organic compounds based on their molecular characteristics.
