description: QSAR-TID-101131 is a dataset that consists of 7,529 chemical compounds with potential antimalarial activity. The compounds were tested against the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which causes malaria. The dataset includes several features, such as molecular descriptors and other properties that characterize the compounds. The compounds were also classified into active and inactive categories based on their level of activity against the parasite. The dataset is made publicly available to researchers in pharmacology and drug discovery to aid in the development of new antimalarial medications. It provides a valuable resource for exploring the relationships between chemical properties and antimalarial activity.
