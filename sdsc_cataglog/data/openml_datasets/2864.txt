name: mlr_glmnet_rng
dataset_id: 42455.0
description: The dataset mlr_glmnet_rng contains the results of simulations used to evaluate the glmnet algorithm implemented in the mlr package. It consists of 300 observations and 15 variables. The target variable is binary, indicating success or failure in predicting a specific outcome. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, with 200 and 100 observations respectively. The variables include features related to the complexity parameter of the algorithm, such as alpha and lambda values. The dataset is used to assess the performance of glmnet on various replication runs, allowing for evaluation and comparison of different parameter settings.
