name: QSAR-TID-12719
dataset_id: 3631.0
description: The QSAR-TID-12719 dataset consists of 1,271 molecular structures with accompanying activity values for their anti-HIV-1 activity. The data was collected to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the biological activity of molecules. The molecular structures are represented by descriptors such as atom types, bond counts, and topological indices. Additionally, the dataset contains binary fingerprints and physicochemical properties of the compounds. The activity values, obtained through in vitro experiments, are expressed as IC50 values, which represent the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of viral replication. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and understanding the relationships between molecular structures and anti-HIV activity.
