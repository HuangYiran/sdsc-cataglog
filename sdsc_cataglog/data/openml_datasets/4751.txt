name: alarm_0
dataset_id: 45109.0
description: The dataset alarm_0 is a part of the Bayesian Alarm Network project that aims to provide a systematic analysis of alarm systems. It contains 37 instances of alarms raised in a facility, along with corresponding information like the level of pollution, temperature, and specific malfunctions. Each instance records the occurrence of alarms with a boolean value, indicating whether an alarm was raised or not. The dataset also contains information about the actual conditions in the facility at the time of alarm occurrence. The purpose of this dataset is to train and test machine learning algorithms to predict future alarm occurrences based on the provided information.
