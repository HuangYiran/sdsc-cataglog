name: QSAR-TID-10682
dataset_id: 4121.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10682 contains information about the chemical compounds' toxicity. It comprises 1055 molecules, with 330 molecular descriptors calculated for each compound. The molecular descriptors are divided into three categories: constitutional descriptors, topological descriptors, and connectivity indices. These descriptors provide information on the structural features of the compounds. The dataset also includes binary class labels indicating whether each compound is toxic or non-toxic. The goal of this dataset is to build a predictive model that can correctly classify the toxicity of chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors.
