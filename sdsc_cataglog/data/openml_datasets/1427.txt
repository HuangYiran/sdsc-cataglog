name: QSAR-TID-11977
dataset_id: 3407.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-11977 contains information related to several physicochemical properties of molecules that can be used to predict their toxicity towards aquatic organisms. The data includes measured properties such as molecular weight, solubility, and octanol-water partition coefficient. The dataset comprises a total of 11977 instances with 8 input features and one output variable representing the toxicity level. The aim of this dataset is to enable the development of machine learning models that can accurately predict the toxicity of chemicals, leading to improved methods for assessing the potential environmental impact of various substances.
