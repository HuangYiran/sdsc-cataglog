name: QSAR-Bioconcentration-Classes-Data-Set
dataset_id: 43699.0
description: The QSAR-Bioconcentration-Classes-Data-Set is a dataset that contains information on different chemical compounds and their ability to accumulate in living organisms. It consists of 684 compounds, each with 10 numerical and 1 categorical attribute. The dataset aims to classify these compounds into high and low bioconcentration classes. The numerical attributes represent molecular descriptors, while the categorical attribute represents the bioconcentration factor class. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to develop models that can predict the bioconcentration potential of chemicals. It provides valuable insights into the relationship between chemical structure and bioconcentration, aiding in environmental risk assessment.
