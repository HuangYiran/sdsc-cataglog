name: grid_stability
dataset_id: 44973.0
description: The dataset grid_stability consists of 10,000 samples and nine input variables. The aim is to predict the stability status of the electrical grid based on these input variables. The dataset contains balanced classes, as there are an equal number of samples for each stability class. The input variables include features such as the power generated by the generator, the temperature of cooling water, and the ambient humidity. The stability status is a binary variable indicating whether the grid is stable or unstable. This dataset can be used for machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the stability of electrical grids.
