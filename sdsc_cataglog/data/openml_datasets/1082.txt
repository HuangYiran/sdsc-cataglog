name: QSAR-TID-10444
dataset_id: 3058.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10444 consists of 1,044 molecular compounds with their biological activity values against a target protein. The compounds are described using 68 molecular descriptors, including physicochemical and topological properties. The biological activity is measured using the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) that represents the concentration of a compound that inhibits the target protein by 50%. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the biological activity of similar compounds. This can aid in the discovery of potential drug candidates and understanding the molecular factors influencing biological activity.
