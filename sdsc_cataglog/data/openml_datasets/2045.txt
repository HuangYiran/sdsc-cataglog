name: QSAR-TID-10402
dataset_id: 4031.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-10402 contains information about the biological activity of several chemical compounds. It includes 1055 instances with an equal number of active and inactive compounds. The dataset has a total of 754 molecular descriptors, which describe the structural, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of the compounds. These descriptors include attributes such as the number of atoms, electronegativity, and solubility. The dataset was created for the prediction of the biological activity of new compounds using machine learning techniques. It is commonly used in the field of cheminformatics for developing QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models.
