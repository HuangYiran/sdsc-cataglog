name: QSAR-TID-30030
dataset_id: 4072.0
description: QSAR-TID-30030 is a dataset that comprises 30030 compounds with their respective experimentally measured toxicity values. It is used for the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. The dataset contains various descriptors, including topological, geometric, electronic, constitutional, and informational descriptors, that contribute to defining the compounds' features. The toxicity values are measured using in vitro cytotoxicity assays, and the compounds are classified into active and inactive categories based on their toxicity. This dataset can be utilized to develop predictive models or conduct studies related to toxicity prediction, drug design, and chemical safety assessment.
