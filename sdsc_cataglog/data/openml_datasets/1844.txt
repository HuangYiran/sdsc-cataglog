name: QSAR-TID-12566
dataset_id: 3829.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-12566 consists of 1055 chemical compounds with numerical and categorical features. It is a multiclass classification problem with four classes. The dataset contains various attributes such as molecular descriptors, fingerprints, and constitutional parameters. The compounds are ranked based on their chemical reactivity towards an endpoint and are labeled accordingly as highly reactive, moderately reactive, slightly reactive, or non-reactive. The goal of this dataset is to develop a predictive model to classify the reactivity of compounds. There is a class imbalance issue as non-reactive compounds dominate the dataset. It is suitable for machine learning tasks aiming to discriminate between different levels of reactivity in chemical compounds.
