name: QSAR-TID-100845
dataset_id: 3801.0
description: The dataset QSAR-TID-100845 consists of information related to the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of chemical compounds. It includes 1500 instances where each instance comprises 204 descriptors and an activity class label, specifically indicating whether the compound is either active or inactive against a particular target. The activity class label is represented by the variable "activity". The dataset is curated for modeling the activity of chemical compounds against target molecules, making it useful for researchers and data scientists interested in drug discovery and development. Potential applications include predictive modeling, classification, and feature selection in the field of molecular activity prediction.
