description: QSAR-TID-10541 is a dataset consisting of 10541 instances with 41 attributes. It was gathered for the purpose of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The dataset is focused on chemical compounds and their interactions with biological targets. The compounds were represented using topological descriptors that encode properties like size, shape, and connectivity of the molecules. The dataset includes activity classes indicating whether the compound shows inhibitory, weak inhibitory, or neutral activity towards the target. The data is useful for training machine learning models to predict the activity of new chemical compounds towards biological targets based on their molecular structure.
