description: cuML is a suite of libraries that implement machine learning algorithms and mathematical primitives functions that share compatible APIs with other RAPIDS projects. cuML enables data scientists, researchers, and software engineers to run traditional tabular ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA programming. In most cases, cuML's Python API matches the API from scikit-learn. For large datasets, these GPU-based implementations can complete 10-50x faster than their CPU equivalents. As an example, the following Python snippet loads input and computes DBSCAN clusters, all on GPU, using cuDF. cuML also features multi-GPU and multi-node-multi-GPU operation, using Dask, for a growing list of algorithms. For additional examples, browse our complete API documentation, or check out our example walkthrough notebooks. Finally, you can find complete end-to-end examples in the notebooks-contrib repo. Please see the RAPIDS Release Selector for the command line to install either nightly or official release cuML packages via Conda or Docker.
