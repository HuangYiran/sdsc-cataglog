description: PixieDust is an open source helper library that works as an add-on to Jupyter notebooks to improve the user experience of working with data. It also fills a gap for users who have no access to configuration files when a notebook is hosted on the cloud. PixieDust is a productivity tool for Python or Scala notebooks, which lets a developer encapsulate business logic into something easy for your customers to consume. PixieDust greatly simplifies working with Python display libraries like matplotlib, but works just as effectively in Scala notebooks too. You no longer have compromise your love of Scala to generate great charts. PixieDust lets you bring robust Python visualization options to your Scala notebooks. PixieDust's current capabilities include: packageManager, visualizations, embedded apps, export, Scala bridge, and Spark progress monitor.
