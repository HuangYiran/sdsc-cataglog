description: The **Intel® HE transformer for nGraph™** is a Homomorphic Encryption (HE) backend to the **Intel® nGraph Compiler**, Intel's graph compiler for Artificial Neural Networks. Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on encrypted data, and is an attractive remedy to increasing concerns about data privacy in the field of machine learning. This project is meant as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the feasibility of HE on local machines. The goal is to measure performance of various HE schemes for deep learning. Currently, we support the CKKS encryption scheme, implemented by the Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL) from Microsoft Research. Additionally, we integrate with the **Intel® nGraph™ Compiler and runtime engine for TensorFlow** to allow users to run inference on trained neural networks through Tensorflow.
