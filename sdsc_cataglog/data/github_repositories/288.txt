description: iNNvestigate is a library that provides a common interface and out-of-the-box implementation for many analysis methods aimed at making analyzing neural networks' predictions easy. It contains implementations for several methods such as Saliency, Deconvnet, GuidedBackprop, SmoothGrad, IntegratedGradients, LRP, PatternNet, and PatternAttribution. If you use this code, please star the repository and cite the following paper. iNNvestigate is based on Keras and TensorFlow 2 and can be installed with the following commands. Please note that iNNvestigate currently requires disabling TF2's eager execution. To use the example scripts and notebooks, one additionally needs to install the package matplotlib. The library's tests can be executed via `pytest`. The iNNvestigate library contains implementations for various methods. Checkout the available documentation to learn more about this library and how to contribute or add your analysis method.
