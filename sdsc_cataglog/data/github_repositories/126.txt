description: If you're a data scientist or data engineer, you might be familiar with working on an ETL project. SETL (pronounced "settle") is a Scala ETL framework powered by Apache Spark that helps you structure your Spark ETL projects, modularize your data transformation logic and speed up your development. Automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, fund open source developers, and read more about the GitHub community articles. In this guide, we will introduce SETL except for its installation. We will cover how to use SETL in a new project, in an existing project, show code examples for context initialization, implementation of factory, and generating a pipeline diagram. We will also cover how to configure the app and dependencies. Finally, you can check the contributing guide and footer navigation for more information.
