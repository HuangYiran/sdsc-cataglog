description: XAI is a Machine Learning library that is designed with AI explainability in.its core. XAI contains various tools that enable for analysis and evaluation.of data and models. The XAI library is maintained by The Institute for Ethical.AI & ML, and it was developed based on the 8 principles for Responsible.Machine Learning. We see the challenge of explainability as more than just an algorithmic.challenge, which requires a combination of data science best practices with.domain-specific knowledge. The XAI library is designed to empower machine.learning engineers and relevant domain experts to analyse the end-to-end.solution and identify discrepancies that may result in sub-optimal performance.relative to the objectives required. More broadly, the XAI library is designed.using the 3-steps of explainable machine learning, which involve 1) data.analysis, 2) model evaluation, and 3) production monitoring.
