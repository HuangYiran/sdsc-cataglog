description: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform for the modern data stack that can automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, provide instant dev environments, help write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code and fund open source developers. It is built with love by Acryl Data and LinkedIn and hosted on Acryl Data's DataHub Docs platform. It offers various features and a roadmap to follow, a demo environment to explore without installing it locally, and a quickstart guide to get started with Docker. DataHub also provides source code, repositories, and releases following the SemVer Specification and Keep a Changelog convention. It welcomes contributions from the community and has a contrib directory for incubating experimental features. DataHub is adopted by several companies, and there are select articles and talks available as well.
