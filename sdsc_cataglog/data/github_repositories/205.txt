description: Alibi Detect is an open source Python library focused on outlier, adversarial, and drift detection. The package aims to cover both online and offline detectors for tabular data, text, images and time series. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch backends are supported for drift detection. For more background on the importance of monitoring outliers and distributions in a production setting, check out this talk from the Challenges in Deploying and Monitoring Machine Learning Systems ICML 2020 workshop, based on the paper Monitoring and explainability of models in production and referencing Alibi Detect. For a thorough introduction to drift detection, check out Protecting Your Machine Learning Against Drift: An Introduction. The package, alibi-detect can be installed from conda-forge using mamba. The supported algorithms include Outlier Detection, Adversarial Detection, and Drift Detection. Alibi-detect is integrated in the open source machine learning model deployment platform Seldon Core and model serving framework KFServing.
