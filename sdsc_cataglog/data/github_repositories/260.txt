description: Substra is an open source federated learning (FL) software. It enables the.training and validation of machine learning models on distributed datasets. It.provides a flexible Python interface and a web application to run federated.learning training at scale. This specific repository is the low-level Python.library used to interact with a Substra network. Substra's main usage is in production environments. It has already been.deployed and used by hospitals and biotech companies (see the MELLODDY project.for instance). Substra can also be used on a single machine to perform FL.simulations and debug code. Substra was originally developed by Owkin and is now hosted by the Linux.Foundation for AI and Data. Today Owkin is the main contributor to Substra.
