description: Introducing ModelChimp - an experiment tracker for Deep Learning and Machine Learning experiments. With ModelChimp, data scientists and machine learning engineers/enthusiasts can spend more time on experiments and not on managing the data related to the experiments. ModelChimp provides features like automating any workflow, hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, creating instant dev environments, collaborating outside of code, funding open source developers and writing better code with AI. Choose either Docker based installation or the manual approach. For Docker based installation, download Docker from https://docs.docker.com/install/ and after starting ModelChimp server, access it at http://localhost:8000. For manual installation, refer to the documentation. Production Deployment can be done referring to the docker-compose.local.yml with the container orchestration of your choice. If you'd like to start ModelChimp manually, use the following command "docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build -d" to start the containers in daemon mode on the machine where ModelChimp resides.
