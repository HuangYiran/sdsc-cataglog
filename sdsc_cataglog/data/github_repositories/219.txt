description: "DeepDetect (https://www.deepdetect.com/) is a machine learning API and server written in C++11. It makes state of the art machine learning easy to work with and integrate into existing applications. It has support for both training and inference, with automatic conversion to embedded platforms with TensorRT (NVidia GPU) and NCNN (ARM CPU). It implements support for supervised and unsupervised deep learning of images, text, time series and other data, with focus on simplicity and ease of use, test and connection into existing applications. It supports classification, object detection, segmentation, regression, autoencoders, and relies on external machine learning libraries through a very generic and flexible API. At the moment it has support for machine learning functionalities per library."
