description: The Deep Visualization Toolbox is a tool that allows for the generation of neuron-by-neuron visualizations using regularized optimization, for which the code is provided in this repository. It offers two main sets of features: running images forward and backward through the network to visualize activations and compute derivatives of any unit with respect to any other unit, and computing three types of per-unit visualizations (max image, deconv of max image, and activation maximization via regularized optimization) that are computed outside of the toolbox and loaded into it as jpgs. The toolbox comes with the default caffenet-yos model weights and pre-computed visualizations, but it also allows for visualization of custom models. To install the toolbox, users need to compile the deconv-deep-vis-toolbox branch of caffe and install prerequisites (python-opencv, scipy, and scikit-image), as well as download and configure the Deep Visualization Toolbox code. Troubleshooting tips and alternative methods of running the toolbox are also provided.
