description: LOFO (Leave One Feature Out) Importance calculates the importances of a set of features based on a metric of choice, for a model of choice, by iteratively removing each feature from the set, and evaluating the performance of the model, with a validation scheme of choice, based on the chosen metric. LOFO first evaluates the performance of the model with all the input features included, then iteratively removes one feature at a time, retrains the model, and evaluates its performance on a validation set. The mean and standard deviation (across the folds) of the importance of each feature is then reported. LOFO Importance has several advantages compared to other importance types and can be installed using pip install lofo-importance. Examples of LOFO Importance include Microsoft Malware Prediction Competition and Kaggle's TReNDS Competition. For those who find running the LOFO Importance package too time-costly, Fast LOFO (FLOFO) is recommended as a faster alternative.
