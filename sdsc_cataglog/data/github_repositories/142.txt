description: Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. It was made for dataflow and supports highly configurable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of its key features include automating workflows, hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, providing instant dev environments, enabling AI to optimize code writing, and facilitating collaboration outside of code. For getting started with NiFi, one can execute 'mvn clean install -DskipTests' to compile tests but skip running them, and direct the browser to http://localhost:8080/nifi/ to see the screen. NiFi User Guide provides help to build the first data flow. For any help, questions can be asked on Apache NiFi Slack Workspace and IRC. To submit a bug report, one can file a Jira. NiFi is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and includes cryptographic software.
