description: Fiber is a Python distributed computing library for modern computer clusters. Originally, it was developed to power large scale parallel scientific computation projects like POET and it has been used to power similar projects within Uber. Fiber implements most of multiprocessing's API including `Process`, `SimpleQueue`, `Pool`, `Pipe`, `Manager` and it has its own extension to the multiprocessing's API to make it easy to compose large scale distributed applications. For the detailed API guild, check out here.
