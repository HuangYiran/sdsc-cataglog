description: Captum is a model interpretability and understanding library for PyTorch. It provides state-of-the-art algorithms, including Integrated Gradients, to provide researchers and developers with an easy way to understand which features are contributing to a model’s output. Captum helps ML researchers more easily implement interpretability algorithms that can interact with PyTorch models. Captum also allows researchers to quickly benchmark their work against other existing algorithms available in the library. The primary audiences for Captum are model developers who are looking to improve their models and interpretability researchers focused on identifying algorithms that can better interpret many types of models. Captum can also be used by application engineers who are using trained models in production. Captum provides easier troubleshooting through improved model interpretability, and the potential for delivering better explanations to end users on why they’re seeing a specific piece of content, such as a movie recommendation.
