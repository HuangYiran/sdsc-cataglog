description: "Differential Privacy is a concept that provides techniques to protect sensitive information while still allowing data analysis. This repository contains libraries to generate ε- and (ε, δ)-differentially private statistics over datasets. It contains various tools and supports multiple algorithms. The DP building block libraries and Privacy on Beam are suitable for research, experimental, or production use cases, while some other tools are currently experimental and subject to change. It is important to note that to run the differential privacy library, Bazel and Git installation are required. Once installed, you can clone the differential-privacy directory and build the differential privacy library using Bazel. It is essential to keep in mind the caveats of the DP building block libraries that require a bound on the maximum number of contributions each user can make to a single aggregation. Our floating-point implementations are subject to vulnerabilities. We will continue to publish updates and improvements, but please note that this is not an officially supported Google product."
