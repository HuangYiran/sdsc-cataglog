description: MLeap allows data scientists and engineers to deploy machine learning pipelines from Spark and Scikit-learn to a portable format and execution engine. Using the MLeap execution engine and serialization format, we provide a performant, portable, and easy-to-integrate production library for machine learning data pipelines and algorithms. For portability, MLeap is built on the JVM and only uses serialization formats that are widely adopted. The software also provides a high level of integration with existing technologies. MLeap is built against Scala 2.12 and Java 11 and allows users to choose the right version of the `mleap-spark` module to export their pipeline. Additionally, MLeap provides documentation on link with Maven or SBT and Spark integration. There is support for PySpark integration, create and export a Spark pipeline, create and export a Scikit-Learn pipeline, and load and transform using MLeap. For more documentation, please see the MLeap documentation.
