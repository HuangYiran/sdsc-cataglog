description: 'Gensim is a Python library for _topic modelling_ , _document indexing_ and._similarity retrieval_ with large corpora. Target audience is the _natural.language processing_ (NLP) and _information retrieval_ (IR) community. If this feature list left you scratching your head, you can first read more.about the Vector Space Model and unsupervised document analysis on Wikipedia. Many scientific algorithms can be expressed in terms of large matrix.operations (see the BLAS note above). Gensim taps into these low-level BLAS.libraries, by means of its dependency on NumPy. So while gensim-the-top-level-.code is pure Python, it actually executes highly optimized Fortran/C under the.hood, including multithreading (if your BLAS is so configured). Memory-wise, gensim makes heavy use of Python’s built-in generators and.iterators for streamed data processing. Memory efficiency was one of gensim’s.design goals, and is a central feature of gensim, rather than something bolted.on as an afterthought. For commercial support, please see Gensim sponsorship.'
