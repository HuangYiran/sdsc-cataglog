description: **The Deep Learning framework to train, deploy, and ship AI products Lightning.fast.** 

Introducing Lightning, an AI framework that automates any workflow, hosts and manages packages, finds and fixes vulnerabilities, provides instant dev environments, allows collaboration outside of code, funds open source developers, and offers GitHub community articles. This lightning-fast framework helps in writing better code with AI. There are no suggested jumps to results; however, Lightning has three core packages: PyTorch Lightning, Lightning Fabric, and Lightning Apps. These packages allow for granular control over how much abstraction one wants to add over PyTorch. PyTorch Lightning trains and deploys PyTorch at scale and has over 40 advanced features designed for professional AI research at scale. Lightning Fabric offers expert-level control over PyTorch training loop and scaling strategy and is designed for the most complex models like foundation model scaling, LLMs, diffusion, transformers, reinforcement learning, active learning, of any size. Lightning Apps allow for the building of AI products and ML workflows, removing cloud infrastructure boilerplate so users can focus on solving the research or business problems.
