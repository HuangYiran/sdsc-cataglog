description: **MedTagger** is a collaborative framework for annotating medical datasets. Its main goal is to design and develop a software environment that helps in aggregation and labeling huge datasets of medical scans, powered by the idea of crowdsourcing. The platform also provides a mechanism for label validation, thus making produced datasets of labels more reliable for future use. MedTagger is still under heavy development, so please keep in mind that many things may change or new versions may not be fully backward compatible. To set up MedTagger locally, you can use a Vagrant virtual machine or Docker-Compose. More information about setting up the local Jupyter Notebook session and MedTagger's technology stack can be found in its documentation.
