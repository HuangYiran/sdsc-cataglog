description: Fission is a fast serverless framework for Kubernetes with a focus on developer productivity and high performance. Fission operates on just the code: Docker and Kubernetes are abstracted away under normal operation, though you can use both to extend Fission if you want to. Fission is extensible to any language; the core is written in Go, and language-specific parts are isolated in something called environments. Fission maintains a pool of "warm" containers that each contain a small dynamic loader. When a function is first called, i.e. "cold-started", a running container is chosen and the function is loaded. This pool is what makes Fission fast: cold-start latencies are typically about 100msec. Building on Kubernetes also means that anything you do for operations on your Kubernetes cluster such as monitoring or log aggregation also helps with ops on your Fission deployment.
