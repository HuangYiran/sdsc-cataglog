description: The Semantic Segmentation Editor is a web-based labeling tool for creating AI training data sets for 2D and 3D images. It is Meteor app developed with React, Paper.js, and three.js. The tool supports images (.jpg or .png) and point clouds (.pcd), and it includes two editing modes: the Bitmap Image Editor, which is dedicated to the labeling of jpg and png files by drawing polygons, and the PCD Point Cloud Editor, which is dedicated to the labeling of point clouds by creating objects made of subsets of 3D points. The tool also has a file navigator that lets you browse available files to select an image or a point cloud for labeling. It is possible to customize the tool by modifying the settings.json file, which is explained in detail in the documentation. The tool can be run using Docker Compose or it can be installed manually.
