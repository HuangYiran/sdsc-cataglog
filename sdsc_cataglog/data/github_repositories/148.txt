description: Stable Baselines is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms based on OpenAI Baselines. These algorithms will make it easier for the research community and industry to replicate, refine, and identify new ideas and will create good baselines to build projects on top of. It is a fork of OpenAI Baselines with a major structural refactoring and code cleanups. Stable-Baselines also provides RL Baselines Zoo, a collection of pre-trained Reinforcement Learning agents that includes basic scripts for training, evaluating agents, tuning hyperparameters, and recording videos. The package is available for installation using pip and supports Tensorflow versions from 1.8.0 to 1.14.0.
