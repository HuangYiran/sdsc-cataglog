description: YouTokenToMe is an unsupervised text tokenizer that focuses on computational efficiency. It currently implements fast Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and is much faster in training and tokenization than Hugging Face, fastBPE, and SentencePiece. YouTokenToMe's implementation is also much faster in some test cases - up to 60 times faster. It offers a Python interface for installation alongside many other features such as hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, instant dev environments, and collaborating outside of code. Users can also fund open source developers and access GitHub community articles. YouTokenToMe's BPE model allows users to handle tokenization of subwords as well as word boundaries. It also provides a command line interface with features such as training BPE models based on text files, applying BPE encoding for a corpus of sentences, and converting IDs back to text.
