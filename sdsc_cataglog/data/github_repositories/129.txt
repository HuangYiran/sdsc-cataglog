description: From the Latin _praefectus_, meaning "one who is in charge", a prefect is an official who oversees a domain and makes sure that the rules are followed. Similarly, Prefect is responsible for making sure that workflows execute properly. It also happens to be the name of a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book, _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. Thanks to Prefect's growing task library and deep ecosystem integrations, building data applications is easier than ever.
