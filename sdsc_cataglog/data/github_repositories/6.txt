description: "The TensorFlow Lite to microcontroller (TFL2uC) tool automates the optimization of TensorFlow models and conversion to a TensorFlow Lite C++ model for easy integration into a C++ project. The optimization algorithms pruning and quantization can be applied to reduce the memory requirements of the model and speed up inference. TFL2uC also provides a GUI for easy use. The tool was developed and tested on Windows 10 using Python v.3.7.10 and pip v.21.0.1, with all other required frameworks located in the requirements.txt file. To use TFL2uC, simply install the required frameworks using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Full installation instructions are provided in the TFL2uC Table of Contents.
