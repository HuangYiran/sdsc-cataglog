description: Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) in PyTorch is a framework for discovering novel neural network architectures through parameter sharing, reducing the computational requirement of Neural Architecture Search by 1000x. This PyTorch implementation includes discovering recurrent cells and designing convolutional neural networks. The discovered ENAS cells for datasets like Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 are showcased, along with the CNN network discovered for CIFAR-10. The framework requires training of controller LSTM _θ_ and shared parameters _ω_, and users can explore the training details such as reward, entropy, and loss with tensorboard. More configurations can be found in the link provided.
