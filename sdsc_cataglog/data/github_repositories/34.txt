description: jActivity2 is a system designed to collect different sensor data on smartphones to train classifiers for the web. It is implemented as part of the Prosperity4All project funded by the European Union. A web front-end allows web-developers to collect data for a given context with any available sensor. This data is stored in a MySQL database on the server, where it can be retrieved to create classifiers which run inside a website to detect the context. jActivity2 requires Docker and docker-compose. The available functionality includes Decision Trees as PMML models and providing training data. To integrate jActivity into your website, you can run a decision tree classifier and include the PMML model files. Additionally, jActivity is designed to be modular, enabling it to be extended with your own code for collecting data from additional sensors.
