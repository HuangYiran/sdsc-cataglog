description: BigDL is a distributed deep learning library for Apache Spark; with BigDL, users can write their deep learning applications as standard Spark programs, which can directly run on top of existing Spark or Hadoop clusters. BigDL provides rich deep learning support, high performance, and efficient scaling-out capabilities by leveraging Spark's lightning-fast distributed data processing framework. It is ideal to use BigDL when analyzing significant amounts of data on the same Big Data (Hadoop/Spark) cluster where the data is stored or when adding deep learning functionalities to existing Spark programs and/or workflows. It is highly recommended to use the high-level APIs provided by Analytics Zoo. If you've found BigDL useful for your project, you may cite the paper as follows.
