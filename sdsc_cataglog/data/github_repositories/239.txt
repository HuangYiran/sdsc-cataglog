description: Steppy is a library that addresses two common problems faced by data scientists when building machine learning pipelines. It introduces two simple abstractions: `Step` and `Transformer`, considered the minimal interface for building such pipelines. This library requires `python3.5` or above and is heavily tested on multiple machine learning challenges and educational projects. Steppy aims to become a practical tool for data scientists who can run their experiments easily and change their pipelines with just a few manipulations in the code. It also offers a collection of high-quality implementations of the top deep learning architectures under the same intuitive interface through its steppy-toolkit. Steppy is MIT-licensed and contributions are welcome as outlined in the CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
