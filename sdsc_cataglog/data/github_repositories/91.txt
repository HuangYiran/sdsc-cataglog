description: Nuclio is a high-performance "serverless" framework focused on data, I/O, and compute intensive workloads. It is well integrated with popular data science tools, such as Jupyter and Kubeflow; supports a variety of data and streaming sources; and supports execution over CPUs and GPUs. None of the existing cloud and open-source serverless solutions address all the desired capabilities of a serverless framework, which is why Nuclio was created to fulfill these requirements. It is an extendable open-source framework, using a modular and layered approach that supports constant addition of triggers and runtimes, with the hope that many will join the effort of developing new modules, developer tools, and platforms for Nuclio.
