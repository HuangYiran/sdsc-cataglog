description: Automl-gs is an AutoML tool which offers a _zero code/model definition interface_ to getting an optimized model and data transformation pipeline in multiple popular ML/DL frameworks, with the philosophy that you don't need to know any modern data preprocessing and machine learning engineering techniques to create a powerful prediction workflow. The cost of computing many different models and hyperparameters is much lower than the opportunity cost of a data scientist's time. The models generated by automl-gs are intended to give a strong baseline for solving a given problem, with the resulting code easily tweakable to improve from the baseline. Currently, automl-gs supports the generation of models for regression and classification problems using several Python frameworks. The automl-gs package can be installed via pip and a corresponding ML/DL framework may need to be installed as well. After installation, it can be used directly from the command line or invoked directly from Python. The output of the automl-gs training is a trained model with Python code pipelines, allowing for easy integration into any prediction workflow. Automl-gs generates raw Python code using Jinja templates and trains a model using the generated code in a subprocess, repeating the process using different hyperparameters until it finds the best model.
