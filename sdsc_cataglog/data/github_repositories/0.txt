description: Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data. It helps people take data of any shape or size and publish that as an interactive, explorable website and accompanying API. Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers, and anyone else who has data that they wish to share with the world. To use it, you can install Datasette with Homebrew or pip, and run it on your local server or deploy it to the internet. Datasette Lite is also available for running entirely in your browser.
