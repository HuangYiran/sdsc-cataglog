description: Couler is a platform that aims to provide a unified interface for constructing and managing workflows on different workflow engines, such as Argo Workflows, Tekton Pipelines, and Apache Airflow. Couler is included in CNCF Cloud Native Landscape and LF AI Landscape. It currently only supports Argo Workflows as the workflow orchestration backend. Couler provides Python SDK that provides access to all the available features from Argo Workflows. To install Couler, use "python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/couler-proj/couler --ignore-installed" or clone the repository and run "python setup.py install". Couler also provides examples and tutorials on how to use the platform with Argo Workflows.
