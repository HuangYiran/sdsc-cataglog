description: TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is a Google-production-scale machine learning platform based on TensorFlow. It provides a configuration framework to express ML pipelines consisting of TFX components. TFX pipelines can be orchestrated using Apache Airflow and Kubeflow Pipelines. Both the components themselves as well as the integrations with orchestration systems can be extended. TFX components interact with a ML Metadata backend that keeps a record of component runs, input and output artifacts, and runtime configuration. This metadata backend enables advanced functionality like experiment tracking or warmstarting/resuming ML models from previous runs.
