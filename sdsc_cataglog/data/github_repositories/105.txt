description: Alluxio (formerly known as Tachyon) is a virtual distributed storage system that bridges the gap between computation frameworks and storage systems, enabling computation applications to connect to numerous storage systems through a common interface. The Alluxio project originated from a research project called Tachyon at AMPLab, UC Berkeley, which was the data layer of the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS). For more details, please refer to Haoyuan Li's PhD dissertation. Alluxio is used in production to manage Petabytes of data in many leading companies, with the largest deployment exceeding 3,000 nodes. You can find more use cases at Powered by Alluxio or visit our first community conference (Data Orchestration Summit) to learn from other community members!
