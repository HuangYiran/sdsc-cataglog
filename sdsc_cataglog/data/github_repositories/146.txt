description: Lingvo is a framework for building neural networks in Tensorflow, particularly sequence models. It offers a variety of features, such as automating workflows, hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, providing instant dev environments, using AI to write better code, collaborative tools, and funding open source developers. Lingvo has seen multiple releases, but note that there have been major breaking changes, and older release details are unavailable. To set up Lingvo, you can either install a fixed version through pip or clone the repository and build it with bazel - docker configurations are provided for both cases. Once set up, you can run various models, such as the MNIST image model, machine translation model, GShard transformer based giant language model, or the 3D object detection model. To develop the framework further and potentially contribute pull requests, it is recommended that you clone the repository instead of using pip.
