description: Basin is a visual programming tool that allows users to extract, transform, and load data using a drag-and-drop interface. It can run Spark jobs on any environment and can be used to create complex pipelines and flows. Users can debug and preview their work step by step with an integrated dataview grid viewer and can export their work to pure Python code. Basin can be installed from dockerhub, and a data folder must be created to hold all input and output files. One can run the image by mapping the data directory to a local environment and pointing a browser to http://localhost:3000. Basin can also be installed from source by setting up two containers, "basin-client" and "basin-server". To create new block types, users can define a code template using the C code library template, and the program is free software under the Server Side Public License.
