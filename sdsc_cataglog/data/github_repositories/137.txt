description: Chronos is a replacement for `cron`. It is a distributed and fault-tolerant.scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos that can be used for job.orchestration. It supports custom Mesos executors as well as the default.command executor. Thus by default, Chronos executes `sh` (on most systems.bash) scripts. Chronos can be used to interact with systems such as Hadoop (incl. EMR), even.if the Mesos agents on which execution happens do not have Hadoop installed..Included wrapper scripts allow transfering files and executing them on a.remote machine in the background and using asynchronous callbacks to notify.Chronos of job completion or failures. Chronos is also natively able to.schedule jobs that run inside Docker containers. Chronos has a number of advantages over regular cron. It allows you to.schedule your jobs using ISO8601 repeating interval notation, which enables.more flexibility in job scheduling. Chronos also supports the definition of.jobs triggered by the completion of other jobs. It supports arbitrarily long.dependency chains. The easiest way to use Chronos is to useDC/OS and install chronos via the.universe.
