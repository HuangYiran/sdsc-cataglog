description: VoTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool) is an open source annotation and labeling tool for image and video assets that facilitates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. Written in TypeScript and built with React and Redux, VoTT can be installed as a native application or run from source, and is also available as a stand-alone Web application that can be used in any modern Web browser. The tool helps automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, fund open source developers, and more. With VoTT, users can create connections, projects, and label images and videos, as well as export labels into various formats. VoTT is no longer being maintained, but users can still download and install a release package for their platform, build and run from source, or run as a Web application. To learn more about using VoTT, creating connections and projects, labeling assets, and contributing to the project, users can consult the project repository on GitHub.
