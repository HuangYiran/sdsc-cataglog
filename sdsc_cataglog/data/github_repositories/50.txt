description: Feature-engine is a Python library with multiple transformers to engineer and select features for use in machine learning models. Feature-engine's transformers follow Scikit-learn's functionality with fit() and transform() methods to learn the transforming parameters from the data and then transform it. Current Feature-engine's transformers include functionality for imputation methods, encoding methods, discretisation methods, outlier handling methods, variable transformation methods, variable creation, feature selection, datetime, time series, preprocessing, and wrappers. For installation, it can be downloaded from PyPI using pip or cloned from GitHub. Example usage and documentation can be found in their Jupyter Notebook Gallery or documentation, which is hosted on Read the Docs. The library is licensed under BSD 3-Clause, and you can sponsor them to support further their mission to democratize machine learning and programming tools through open-source software.
