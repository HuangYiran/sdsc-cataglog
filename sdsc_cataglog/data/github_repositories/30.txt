description: The What-If Tool (WIT) provides an easy-to-use interface for expanding understanding of a black-box classification or regression ML model. With the plugin, you can perform inference on a large set of examples and immediately visualize the results in a variety of ways. Additionally, examples can be edited manually or programmatically and re-run through the model in order to see the results of the changes. It contains tooling for investigating model performance and fairness over subsets of a dataset. The purpose of the tool is to give people a simple, intuitive, and powerful way to play with a trained ML model on a set of data through a visual interface with absolutely no code required. The tool can be accessed through TensorBoard or as an extension in a Jupyter or Colab notebook.
