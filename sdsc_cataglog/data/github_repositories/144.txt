description: ðŸ¤— Transformers provides state-of-the-art machine learning models for performing tasks on text, vision, and audio modalities. These transformer models can perform tasks on several combined modalities such as table question answering, optical character recognition, video classification, and visual question answering. The APIs provided by ðŸ¤— Transformers allow for the quick download and use of pre-trained models on a given text, for fine-tuning them on your own datasets, and for sharing them with the community on their model hub. This library is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries â€”Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow, with a seamless integration between them. They also provide custom support for their APIs and models.
