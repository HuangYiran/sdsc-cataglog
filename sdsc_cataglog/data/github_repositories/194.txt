description: AutoKeras is an AutoML system based on Keras which is developed by DATA Lab at Texas A&M University. The goal of AutoKeras is to make machine learning accessible to everyone. AutoKeras can be easily integrated into any workflow and allows to host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, and create instant dev environments. Users can write better code with AI and collaborate outside of code. AutoKeras also enables open source developers to get funding. To install AutoKeras, users can use the pip installation and follow the installation guide for more details. Currently, AutoKeras is only compatible with Python >= 3.7 and TensorFlow >= 2.8.0. For learning resources, users can refer to the official website of AutoKeras and ask questions on their GitHub Discussions. The contributing guide is available for users to learn the best practices and refer to the critical issues added to the milestones for the releases. The development of AutoKeras is acknowledged by the authors in the Journal of machine Learning research.
