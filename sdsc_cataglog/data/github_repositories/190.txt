description: Katib is a Kubernetes-native project for automated machine learning (AutoML). Katib supports Hyperparameter Tuning, Early Stopping and Neural Architecture Search. Katib is the project which is agnostic to machine learning (ML) frameworks. It can tune hyperparameters of applications written in any language of the usersâ€™ choice and natively supports many ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Apache.MXNet, PyTorch, XGBoost, and others. Katib can perform training jobs using any Kubernetes Custom Resources with out. of the box support for Kubeflow Training Operator, Argo Workflows, Tekton Pipelines, and many more. Katib stands for `secretary` in Arabic. Katib supports several search algorithms. Follow the Kubeflow documentation to know more about each algorithm and check the Suggestion service guide to implement your custom algorithm. Please feel free to test the system! Developer guide is a good starting point for our developers.
