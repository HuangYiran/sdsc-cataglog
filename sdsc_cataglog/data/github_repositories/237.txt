description: ClearML is a ML/DL development and production suite that can automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, fund open source developers, and manage experiments with its Experiment Manager. ClearML is supported by the team behind clear.ml, where they build deep learning pipelines and infrastructure for enterprise companies. ClearML contains five main modules, and adding only two lines of code can get you started using ClearML. ClearML is designed to require effortless integration so that teams can preserve their existing methods and practices. ClearML tracks and controls the process of training production-grade deep learning models by associating code version control, research projects, performance metrics, and model provenance. ClearML is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0 and documentation and community support is available on the official website and on YouTube. Feature requests and bug reports can be reported in GitHub issues, and ClearML is committed to always being backwardly compatible.
