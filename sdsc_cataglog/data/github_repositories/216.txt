description: The Multi-Model Server is a service that sets up HTTP endpoints to handle model inference requests. You can use the MMS Server CLI or the pre-configured Docker images to start the service. It is recommended to install and run MMS in a virtual environment using Virtualenv which creates virtual Python environments to provide isolation of dependencies and ease dependency management. MMS requires Python, pip, and Java 8 which can be installed on Ubuntu, CentOS, or macOS. To install MMS, MXNet must be installed first, followed by MMS itself. After installation, the MMS model server can quickly be started using a variety of CLI commands. MMS enables users to package all of their model artifacts into a single model archive, making it easier to share and deploy models. Other relevant documents, recommended production deployments, and external demos powered by MMS are featured, and contributions are welcome.
