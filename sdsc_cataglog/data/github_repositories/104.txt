description: Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database designed for workflows where fast queries and ingest really matter. It excels at powering UIs, running operational (ad-hoc) queries, or handling high concurrency. Consider Druid as an open source alternative to data warehouses for a variety of use cases. The design documentation explains the key concepts. Druid provides a rich set of APIs (via HTTP and JDBC) for loading, managing, and querying your data. You can also interact with Druid via the built-in web console. Load streaming and batch data using a point-and-click wizard to guide you through ingestion setup. Manage your cluster with ease and prototype queries with the built-in query workbench. Visit the official project community page to read about getting involved in contributing to Apache Druid, and how we help one another use and operate Druid.
