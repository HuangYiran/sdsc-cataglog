description: Built based on the Apache Arrow columnar memory format, cuDF is a GPU.DataFrame library for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise.manipulating data. cuDF provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers & data.scientists, so they can use it to easily accelerate their workflows without.going into the details of CUDA programming. For example, the following snippet downloads a CSV, then uses the GPU to parse.it into rows and columns and run calculations. For additional examples, browse our complete API documentation, or check out.our more detailed notebooks. Please see the Demo Docker Repository, choosing a tag based on the NVIDIA CUDA.version you're running. This provides a ready to run Docker container with.example notebooks and data, showcasing how you can utilize cuDF.
