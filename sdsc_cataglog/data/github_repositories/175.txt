description: Gradio is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. With Gradio, you can quickly create a beautiful user interface around your machine learning models or data science workflow and let people "try it out" by dragging-and-dropping in their own images, pasting text, recording their own voice, and interacting with your demo, all through the browser. Gradio is useful for demoing your machine learning models for clients/collaborators/users/students, deploying your models quickly with automatic shareable links and getting feedback on model performance, and debugging your model interactively during development using built-in manipulation and interpretation tools. Gradio requires Python 3.7 or higher.
