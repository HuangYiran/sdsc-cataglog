description: Marquez is an open source **metadata service** for the **collection**, **aggregation**, and **visualization** of a data ecosystem's metadata. It maintains the provenance of how datasets are consumed and produced, provides global visibility into job runtime and frequency of dataset access, centralization of dataset lifecycle management, and much more. Marquez was released and open sourced by WeWork. It is an LF AI & Data Foundation incubation project under active development, and we'd love your help! Marquez provides a simple way to collect and view _dataset_, _job_, and _run_ metadata using OpenLineage.
