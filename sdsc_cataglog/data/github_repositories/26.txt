description: TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine.learning models, designed for production environments. It deals with the._inference_ aspect of machine learning, taking models after _training_ and.managing their lifetimes, providing clients with versioned access via a high-.performance, reference-counted lookup table. TensorFlow Serving provides out-.of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to.serve other types of models and data. To note a few features, you can serve a Tensorflow model in 60 seconds and follow an end-to-end training and serving tutorial. Please refer to the official TensorFlow website for more information.
