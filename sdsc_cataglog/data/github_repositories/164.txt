description: "Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. Online documentation is available at seaborn.pydata.org. The docs include a tutorial, example gallery, API reference, FAQ, and other useful information. Seaborn supports Python 3.8+. Some advanced statistical functionality requires scipy and/or statsmodels. The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI. Seaborn can also be installed with conda. A paper describing seaborn has been published in the Journal of Open Source Software. Testing seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the dev extra. Seaborn development takes place on Github."
