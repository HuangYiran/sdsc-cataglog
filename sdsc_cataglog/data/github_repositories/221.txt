description: The cortex is a production infrastructure designed for machine learning at scale, featuring serverless workloads, automated cluster management, and CI/CD and observability integrations. It allows for deploying, managing, and scaling machine learning models in production by elastically scaling clusters with CPU and GPU instances, running workloads on spot instances with automated on-demand backups, and creating multiple clusters with different configurations. Cortex also sends metrics to any monitoring tool or uses pre-built Grafana dashboards and streams logs to any log management tool or uses the pre-built CloudWatch integration. Moreover, it runs on top of EKS to scale workloads reliably and cost-effectively and deploys clusters into a VPC on the AWS account to keep data private.
