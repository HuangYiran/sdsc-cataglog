description: `Themis-ml` is a Python library built on top of `pandas` and `sklearn` that implements fairness-aware machine learning algorithms. Its features include measuring and mitigating discrimination, preprocessing, model estimation, and postprocessing. It also provides utility functions for loading freely available datasets from a variety of sources. This library defines fairness as the inverse of discrimination and provides different techniques to ensure fairness in machine learning predictions. The source code is hosted on GitHub, and the latest released version can be installed with `conda` or `pip`. For more information, visit the official documentation and the references for the discrimination discovery and fairness-aware methods implemented in `themis-ml`.
