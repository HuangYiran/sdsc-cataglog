description: **Lucid is a collection of infrastructure and tools for research in neural network interpretability.** We're not currently supporting tensorflow 2! If you'd like to use lucid in colab which defaults to tensorflow 2, add `%tensorflow_version 1.x` magic to a cell before you import tensorflow: **Lucid is research code, not production code. We provide no guarantee it will work for your use case. Lucid is maintained by volunteers who are unable to provide significant technical support.** Start visualizing neural networks _**with no setup**_. The following notebooks run right from your browser, thanks to Colaboratory. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. You can run the notebooks on your local machine, too. Clone the repository and find them in the `notebooks` subfolder. You will need to run a local instance of the Jupyter notebook environment to execute them. The lucid notebooks include Tutorial Notebooks, Feature Visualization Notebooks, Building Blocks Notebooks, Differentiable Image Parameterizations Notebooks, Activation Atlas Notebooks, and Miscellaneous Notebooks.
