description: Neural Architecture Search with Controller RNN is a basic implementation of Controller RNN from Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning and Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition. The goal is to maximize score in 10 epochs of training on CIFAR-10 by trying a toy CNN model with 4 CNN layers with different filter sizes (16, 32, 64) and kernel sizes (1, 3). After 50 steps, it converges to the "state space" of (3x3, 64)-(3x3, 64)-(3x3, 32)-(3x3, 64).
