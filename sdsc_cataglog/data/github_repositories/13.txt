description: NNEF-Tools is a repository containing various tools, such as a parser in C++ and Python, for generating and consuming NNEF documents. This enables a diverse range of devices and platforms to use a rich mix of neural network training tools and inference engines, thus reducing machine learning deployment fragmentation. Among the tools in the repository are converters for deep learning frameworks and pre-trained models in TensorFlow, Caffe, Caffe2, and ONNX to NNEF format, with a Model Zoo containing NNEF models converted from various sources. The NNEF-Tools has recently undergone spec version updates, various bug fixes, and general tool reworking, and provides a thorough readme for using the tools.
