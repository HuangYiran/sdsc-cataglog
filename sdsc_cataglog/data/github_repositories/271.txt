description: _TensorFlow Model Analysis_ (TFMA) is a library for evaluating TensorFlow models. It allows users to evaluate their models on large amounts of data in a distributed manner, using the same metrics defined in their trainer. These metrics can be computed over different slices of data and visualized in Jupyter notebooks. The recommended way to install TFMA is using the PyPI package, but it can also be installed from source. TFMA has notable dependencies like TensorFlow, Apache Beam, and Apache Arrow. For more information on using TFMA, see the get started guide.
