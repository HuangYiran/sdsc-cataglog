description: In this paper, we describe a tuple expansion procedure which reconstructs rich information from semantically poor SQL data types such as strings, integers, and floating point numbers. We then use this procedure as the foundation of a new user-guided outlier detection framework, dBoost, which relies on inference and statistical modeling of heterogeneous data to flag suspicious fields in database tuples. This repository contains our implementation, publicly available under version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
