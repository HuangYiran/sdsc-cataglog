description: Apache Samza is a distributed stream processing framework. It uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. Samza's key features include: automating any workflow, hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, providing instant dev environments, and writing better code with AI. To try Samza, check out Hello Samza and read the Background page to learn more about it. Samza can be built from a git checkout or a source release, and it requires Gradle to be installed on the source machine. Samza is built with Java 8 and can run in a Java 8 runtime environment, but it also supports running in a Java 11 runtime environment. To run Samza, use the provided instructions and tools, such as `./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` for checking the Java code style, `./gradlew samza-shell:runJob` for running a job defined in a properties file, and `./gradlew samza-shell:checkpointTool` for inspecting a job's latest checkpoint. As a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation, Samza follows ASF rules and has its contributor corner. Note that Samza's git repository does not support git pull request.
