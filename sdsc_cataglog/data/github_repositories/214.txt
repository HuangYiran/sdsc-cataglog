description: REST web service for scoring PMML models. Openscoring client and server uber-JAR files are distributed via the GitHub releases page, and the Openscoring webapp WAR file is distributed via the Maven Central repository. This README file corresponds to latest source code snapshot. In order to follow its instructions as closely as possible, it's recommended to download the latest binary release. The current version is **2.1.1** (25 September, 2022): ### Source code snapshot. Enter the project root directory and build using Apache Maven: The build produces two uber-JAR files and a WAR file. The example PMML file `DecisionTreeIris.pmml` along with example JSON and CSV files can be found in the `openscoring-service/src/etc` directory. Launch the executable uber-JAR file: java -jar openscoring-server-executable-${version}.jar. By default, the REST web service is started at http://localhost:8080/openscoring. The main class `org.openscoring.server.Main` accepts a number of configuration options for URI customization and other purposes. Please specify `--help` for more information. Advanced configuration can be done by copying the sample Typesafe's Config configuration file `openscoring-.server/application.conf.sample` to a new file `application.conf`, and customize its content to current needs. Use the `config.file` system property to impose changes on the JVM. Moreover, the local configuration overrides the default configuration that is defined in the reference REST web service configuration file `openscoring-.service/src/main/reference.conf`. The deployment and undeployment of models can be automated by launching the `org.openscoring.client.DirectoryDeployer` Java application class from the uber-JAR file, which listens for PMML file addition and removal events on the specified directory ("PMML directory watchdog"). The Model REST API endpoints are available for managing models. Please refer to the README file for more information.
