description: Open Platform for AI (OpenPAI) is a full-stack solution designed to automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant development environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, fund open source developers, and more. OpenPAI incorporates a mature design that has a proven track record in Microsoft's large-scale production environment, and it supports popular AI frameworks and heterogeneous hardware. It is the most complete solution for deep learning, providing a complete training pipeline at one cluster, and it is optimized for distributed computing with docker technology. OpenPAI also provides end-to-end manuals for both cluster users and administrators. The admin manual covers topics such as installation and upgrade, basic cluster management, users and groups management, alerts management, and customization, while the user manual includes job submission and monitoring, data management, collaboration and sharing. There is also a VS Code extension and a command line tool available. OpenPAI is completely open under the MIT license, and contributions from academia and industry are highly welcome.
