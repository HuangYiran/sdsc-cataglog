description: FLOR is a suite of machine learning tools for hindsight logging. Hindsight logging is an optimistic logging practice favored by agile model developers. Model developers log training metrics such as the loss and accuracy by default, and selectively restore additional training data --- like tensor histograms, images, and overlays --- post-hoc, if and when there is evidence of a problem. FLOR is software developed at UC Berkeley's RISE Lab, and is being released as part of an accompanying VLDB publication.
