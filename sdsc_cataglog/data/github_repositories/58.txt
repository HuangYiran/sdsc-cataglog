description: Deequ is a library built on top of Apache Spark for defining "unit tests for data", which measure data quality in large datasets. It works on tabular data and is designed to work with very large datasets that typically live in a distributed filesystem or a data warehouse. The main entry point for defining how you expect your data to look is the VerificationSuite from which you can add Checks that define constraints on attributes of the data. Deequ translates your test to a series of Spark jobs, which it executes to compute metrics on the data. Our library contains much more functionality than what we showed in the basic example. If you would like to reference this package in a research paper, please cite the paper describing it.
