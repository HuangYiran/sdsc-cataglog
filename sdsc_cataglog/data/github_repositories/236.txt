description: Determined is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes building models fast and easy. Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep learning environment â€” which means you can spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure. To use Determined, you can continue using popular DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch; you just need to update your model code to integrate with the Determined API.
