description: The Model Card Toolkit (MCT) streamlines and automates generation of Model Cards [1], machine learning documents that provide context and transparency into a model's development and performance. Integrating the MCT into your ML pipeline enables you to share model metadata and metrics with researchers, developers, reporters, and more. Some use cases of model cards include: Automate any workflow, Host and manage packages, Find and fix vulnerabilities, Instant dev environments, Write better code with AI, Collaborate outside of code, Fund open source developers, GitHub community articles. The Model Card Toolkit is hosted on PyPI, and requires Python 3.7 or later. See the installation guide for more installation options. If you are using TensorFlow Extended (TFX), you can incorporate model card generation into your TFX pipeline via the ModelCardGenerator component. The ModelCardGenerator component has moved to the TFX Addons library and is no longer packaged in Model Card Toolkit from version 2.0.0. Before you can use the component, you will need to install the tfx-addons package. Model cards are stored in proto as an intermediate format. You can see the model card JSON schema in the schema directory.
