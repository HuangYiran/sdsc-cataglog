description: **Hops** ( **H** adoop **O** pen **P** latform-as-a- **S** ervice) is a next.generation distribution of Apache Hadoop with scalable, highly available,.customizable metadata. Hops consists internally of two main sub projects,.HopsFs and HopsYarn. **HopsFS** is a new implementation of the Hadoop.Filesystem (HDFS), that supports multiple stateless NameNodes, where the.metadata is stored in MySQL Cluster, an in-memory distributed database. HopsFS.enables more scalable clusters than Apache HDFS (up to ten times larger.clusters), and enables NameNode metadata to be both customized and analyzed,.because it can now be easily accessed via a SQL API. **HopsYARN** introduces a.distributed stateless Resource Manager, whose state is migrated to MySQL.Cluster. This enables our YARN architecture to have no down-time, with.failover of a ResourceManager happening in a few seconds. Together, HopsFS and.HopsYARN enable Hadoop clusters to scale to larger volumes and higher.throughput.

For more information on Hops, including how to build software, required software, and installation, refer to the Hops Hadoop Distribution Online Documentation.
