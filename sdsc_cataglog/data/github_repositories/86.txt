description: DeepSpeed is an easy-to-use deep learning optimization software suite that powers unprecedented scale and speed for both training and inference. It offers extreme speed and scale for DL training and inference and empowers ChatGPT-like model training with a single click, offering 15x speedup over SOTA RLHF systems with unprecedented cost reduction at all scales. DeepSpeed's three innovation pillars include DeepSpeed-Training, DeepSpeed-Inference, and DeepSpeed-Compression. The DeepSpeed library (this repository) implements and packages the innovations and technologies in DeepSpeed Training, Inference and Compression Pillars into a single easy-to-use, open-sourced repository. It allows for easy composition of multitude of features within a single training, inference or compression pipeline and is heavily adopted by the DL community. DeepSpeed has been used to train many different large-scale models, and it has been integrated with several different popular open-source DL frameworks.
