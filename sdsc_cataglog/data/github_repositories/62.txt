description: Apache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities. It is a streaming-first runtime that supports both batch processing and data streaming programs. Some of its features include elegant and fluent APIs in Java and Scala, high throughput and low event latency, fault-tolerance with exactly-once processing guarantees, and natural back-pressure in streaming programs. Flink also has libraries for Graph processing (batch), Machine Learning (batch), and Complex Event Processing (streaming), and built-in support for iterative programs (BSP) in the DataSet (batch) API. Additionally, Flink has custom memory management for efficient and robust switching between in-memory and out-of-core data processing algorithms, compatibility layers for Apache Hadoop MapReduce, and integration with YARN, HDFS, HBase, and other components of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
