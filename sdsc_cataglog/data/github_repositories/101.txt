description: EdgeDB is a full-fledged database with a powerful and elegant query language, a migrations system, a suite of client libraries in different languages, a command line tool, and—coming soon—a cloud hosting platform. It's more than just a mapper or ORM library, rethinking every aspect of how developers model, migrate, manage, and query their database. With a strict type system, indexes, constraints, computed properties, stored procedures, and shiny new features like link properties, schema mixins, and best-in-class JSON support, EdgeDB introduces types, not tables, and objects, not rows, connected by links. The super-powered EdgeQL query language produces rich, structured objects, deeply fetching related objects is painless, and EdgeQL queries are also composable. The goal is to give developers a next-level experience, with just three commands to open an interactive EdgeQL shell.
