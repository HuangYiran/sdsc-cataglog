description: Introducing the Anomaly Detection Toolkit (ADTK), a Python package for unsupervised/rule-based time series anomaly detection. With ADTK, users can automate workflows, host/manage packages, find/fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, fund open source developers, and access GitHub community articles. ADTK offers a set of common detectors, transformers, and aggregators with unified APIs, as well as pipe classes that connect them into models. The package also provides functions to process and visualize time series and anomaly events. It is recommended to install the most recent stable release of ADTK from PyPI, but users can also install from source code for the latest, though unstable, version. Pull requests are welcome, and more detailed examples of each module of ADTK can be found in the Examples section of the documentation or an interactive demo notebook. ADTK is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0).
