description: `plotly.py` is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python. It is built on top of plotly.js and is a high-level, declarative charting library that ships with over 30 chart types, including scientific charts, 3D graphs, statistical charts, SVG maps, financial charts, and more. `plotly.py` is MIT Licensed and graphs can be viewed in Jupyter notebooks, standalone HTML files, or integrated into Dash applications. It also supports static image export using either the `kaleido` package or the Orca command line utility. For use in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook, install the required packages. Some `plotly.py` features rely on fairly large geographic shape files, which are distributed as a separate `plotly-geo` package that can be installed using pip or conda.
