description: The AI Explainability 360 toolkit is an open-source library that supports interpretability and explainability of datasets and machine learning models. The AI Explainability 360 Python package includes a comprehensive set of algorithms that cover different dimensions of explanations along with proxy explainability metrics. The AI Explainability 360 interactive experience provides a gentle introduction to the concepts and capabilities. To help, they have created some guidance material and a chart that can be consulted. This library is still in development and they encourage you to contribute your explainability algorithms, metrics, and use cases. AIX360 requires specific versions of many Python packages which may conflict with other projects on your system. The supported configurations are laid out, and a virtual environment manager is strongly recommended to ensure dependencies may be installed safely. The setup and installation instructions for AIX360 are provided. The examples directory contains a diverse collection of Jupyter notebooks that use AI Explainability 360 in various ways. If you are using AI Explainability 360 for your work, we encourage you to cite the following paper.
