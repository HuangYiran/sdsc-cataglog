description: Feast ( **Fea** ture **St** ore) is an open source feature store for machine learning. It is the fastest path to manage existing infrastructure to productionize analytic data for model training and online inference. Feast allows ML platform teams to automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, and collaborate outside of code. In this article, we will walk you through the steps to install Feast, create a feature repository, register your feature definitions, and set up your feature store. We will also cover how to explore your data in the web UI, build a training dataset, load feature values into your online store, and read online features at low latency. Additionally, we will provide important resources and information about the functionality and roadmap of Feast.
