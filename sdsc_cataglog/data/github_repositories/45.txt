description: The `mljar-supervised` is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. It is designed to save time for a data scientist. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model. It is not a black-box as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model). The `mljar-supervised` will help you with: automatic documentation, the AutoML report, the decision tree report, and the LightGBM report. It has four built-in modes of work: Explain, Perform, Compete, and Optuna.
