description: MindsDB is a server for artificial intelligence logic, enabling developers to ship AI powered projects from prototyping & experimentation to production in a fast & scalable way. MindsDB abstracts generative AI, large language, and other models as virtual tables on top of enterprise databases, which increases accessibility with organizations and enables development teams to use existing skills to build applications powered by AI. By taking a data-centric approach, MindsDB brings the AI process closer to the source of the data, minimizing the need to build and maintain data pipelines and ETLs, speeding up the time to deployment, and reducing complexity. MindsDB has an active and helpful community and offers features like database integrations, quickstart guides, and documentation for support.
