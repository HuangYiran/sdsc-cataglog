description: Kompute is a general purpose GPU compute framework for cross vendor graphics cards. It is blazing fast, mobile-enabled, asynchronous, and optimized for advanced GPU acceleration use cases. Kompute is backed by the Linux Foundation as a hosted project by the LF AI & Data Foundation. With Kompute, users can automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, and collaborate outside of code. Additionally, users can write better code with AI and fund open source developers. Kompute provides both C++ and Python interfaces, with interactive notebooks and hands-on videos available for both. Its core architecture includes asynchronous and parallel operations, mobile enablement, and more. End-to-end examples are available for both the C++ and Python packages. To get started with Kompute, users can join the Discord & Community Calls, check the documentation, read blog posts, or access examples. Kompute is also open for contributions, and debugging and testing instructions are available for developers.
