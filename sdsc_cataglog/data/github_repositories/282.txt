description: Lightwood is like Legos for Machine Learning. A Pytorch based framework that breaks down machine learning problems into smaller blocks that can be glued together seamlessly with one objective: * Make it so simple that you can build predictive models with as little as one line of code. Learn more from the Lightwood's docs. You can install Lightwood from pip: pip3 install lightwood. Given the simple sensor_data.csv let's predict sensor3 values. from lightwood import Predictor. You can now predict what _sensor3_ value will be. prediction = sensor3_predictor.predict(when={'sensor1':1, 'sensor2':-1}). You can also try Lightwood in Google Colab: ! Thanks for your interest. There are many ways to contribute to this project. Please, check out our Contribution guide.
