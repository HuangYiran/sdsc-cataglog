description: _H2O Flow_ is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media to build machine learning workflows. Think of Flow as a hybrid GUI + REPL + storytelling environment for exploratory data analysis and machine learning, with async, re-scriptable record/replay capabilities. Flow sandboxes and evals user-Javascript in the browser via static analysis and tree-rewriting. Flow is written in CoffeeScript, with a veritable heap of little embedded DSLs for reactive dataflow programming, markup generation, lazy evaluation and multicast signals/slots. There is a nice user guide for _H2O Flow_ housed over in the h2o-3 repo.
