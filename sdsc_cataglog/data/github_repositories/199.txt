description: CleverHans is a Python library designed to benchmark machine learning systems' vulnerability to adversarial examples. It contains reference implementations of attacks against machine learning models to help with benchmarking models against adversarial examples. Since v4.0.0, CleverHans supports JAX, PyTorch, and TF2, and welcomes contributions for all three frameworks. To set up CleverHans, one needs to install Jax, PyTorch, or TensorFlow 2. Users can install CleverHans using pip or by cloning the Github repository. CleverHans offers tutorials and examples to demonstrate its functionalities, but these should not be considered part of the API. When reporting benchmarks, users are asked to specify the version of CleverHans used. The name CleverHans refers to a story about a horse that appeared to have learned how to answer arithmetic questions but had only learned to read social cues. The library is maintained by the CleverHans Lab at the University of Toronto and was previously maintained by Ian Goodfellow and Nicolas Papernot.
