description: `DALEX` is a package that helps to explain the behavior of any model and explore how complex models are working. It creates a wrapper around a predictive model with the `explain()` function and empowers you to compare wrapped models with a collection of local and global explainers. The main philosophy behind `DALEX` explanations is explained in the Explanatory Model Analysis e-book. This package is part of the DrWhy.AI universe and is available in R on CRAN and in Python on PyPI and conda-forge. Additionally, there is an extension package called DALEXtra that provides easy-to-use `explain_*()` functions for models created in popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `H2O`, `tidymodels`, `xgboost`, `mlr` or `mlr3`.
