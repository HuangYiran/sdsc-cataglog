description: "edge-ml is an embedded-first machine learning framework that helps developers build models faster and more robustly with an open-source toolchain for embedded machine learning. With a few simple steps edge-ml lets you record data, label samples, train models and deploy validated embedded machine learning directly on the edge. edge-ml requires minimal initialization and supports upload in real-time as well as in bulk from the edge. Pre-recorded data can also be drag-and-dropped as CSV files to the edge-ml cloud storage. Models are generated using AutoML therefore requiring minimal user configuration. The models are optimized for resource-constrained embedded chips based on hardware-aware neural network training. If you are interested in using _edge-ml_, please go to app.edge-ml.org and register! Please visit our wiki for a comprehensive overview of edge-ml and some excellent tutorials on how to get started. A growing number of organizations support and use _edge-ml_ in their workflows. A comprehensive installation and setup guide is provided in the wiki. If you want to contribute, this is the recommended way to install and run edge-ml. Installing with Docker is also possible, but it's rather meant to be a quick and easy way to run edge-ml, not as development setup. Clone with `--recurse-submodules`-flag to automatically initialize and update each submodule. Run the following command to build the images and to pull the mongoDB image. Services are now available. Run the following command to automatically pull and start the latest version of the dockerized application from Docker Hub. You can now easily debug the different components. Changes can be committed in each sub-repository and pushed from there directly."
