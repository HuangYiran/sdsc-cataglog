description: ForestFlow is a scalable policy-based cloud-native machine learning model server that automates any workflow and provides various features such as hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, instant dev environments, writing better code with AI, and collaborating outside of code. ForestFlow looks to address the proliferation of model serving formats and standards for inference API specifications by adopting widely adopted open source frameworks, formats, and API specifications. ForestFlow also offers pluggable formats, allowing it to continue evolving as the industry matures and support for additional features is needed. Currently, ForestFlow supports models described via MLfLow Model format and a BASIC REST API for model deployment as well as providing two interfaces for inference, including a BASIC REST API and GraphPipe API specification. The ForestFlow team encourages feedback, ideas, and contributions to help develop the roadmap and implementation of ForestFlow.
