description: The Global Explanations for Bias Identification (GEBI) is a proposed attention-based post-hoc explanation framework that allows for the detection and identification of bias in data. The framework involves several steps for data analysis, including the computation of attention maps for a particular class of samples, normalization and preprocessing of input samples and attention maps, reduction of dimensionality, and spectral clustering. Additionally, GEBI provides a bias insertion algorithm that evaluates the presence of unwanted bias in the dataset. The paper validates the framework on a skin lesion dataset and confirms the influence of black frames on deep learning models, showing that bias detection is an important step in improving the robustness of models.
