description: OpenWhisk is a serverless functions platform for building cloud applications. OpenWhisk offers a rich programming model for creating serverless APIs from functions, composing functions into serverless workflows, and connecting events to functions using rules and triggers. The easiest way to start using OpenWhisk is to install the "Standalone" OpenWhisk stack. When the OpenWhisk stack is up, it will open your browser to a functions Playground, typically served from http://localhost:3232. To make use of all OpenWhisk features, you will need the OpenWhisk command line tool called `wsk` which you can download from https://s.apache.org/openwhisk-cli-download. OpenWhisk can also be installed on a Kubernetes cluster. Browse the documentation to learn more about OpenWhisk.
