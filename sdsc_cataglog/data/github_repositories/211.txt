description: Seldon Core is an open source platform to deploy machine learning models on Kubernetes at massive scale. Seldon Core converts your ML models or language wrappers into production REST/GRPC microservices. It provides advanced machine learning capabilities out of the box, such as advanced metrics, request logging, explainers, outlier detectors, A/B tests, canaries, and more. With over 2M installs, Seldon Core is used across organisations to manage large scale deployment of machine learning models, and key benefits include automating any workflow, hosting and managing packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, instant dev environments, writing better code with AI, and collaborating outside of code. The installation process is described in the documentation.
