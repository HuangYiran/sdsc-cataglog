description: This package consists of a small library of optimized tools for doing things that can roughly be considered "group-indexing operations". The most prominent tool is `aggregate`, which is described in detail further down the page. `aggregate` takes an array of values, and an array giving the group number for each of those values. It then returns the sum (or mean, or std, or any,....etc.) of the values in each group. There are multiple implementations of `aggregate` provided. If you use `from.numpy_groupies import aggregate`, the best available implementation will automatically be selected. Otherwise, you can pick a specific version directly. Currently, the following implementations exist: `numpy`, `numba`, `weave`, `cython`. All implementations have the same calling syntax and produce the same outputs, to within some floating-point error. However, some implementations only support a subset of the valid inputs and will sometimes throw `NotImplementedError`.
