description: Pachyderm is a cost-effective data engineering automation platform that enables complex pipeline creation with sophisticated data transformation capabilities across all types of data. It provides parallel processing of multi-stage, language-agnostic pipelines with data versioning and lineage tracking, delivering the ultimate CI/CD engine for data. Pachyderm can be deployed locally or on AWS/GCE/Azure in about 5 minutes, and its comprehensive documentation includes tutorials, example projects, and advanced features. If you want to see some examples and learn about core use cases for Pachyderm, check out their official documentation or refer to their contributing guide. Pachyderm automatically reports anonymized usage metrics, which can be disabled by setting the env variable `METRICS` to `false` in the pachd container. Lastly, Pachyderm has moved some components to a source-available limited license, which allows for access to the source code for modification or redistribution but prohibits use of the code to create competing offerings.
