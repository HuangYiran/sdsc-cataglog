description: Apache Kafka is a platform that allows users to automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, fund open source developers, and access GitHub community articles. Kafka can be built and tested with Java 8, 11 and 17 and Scala 2.12 and 2.13. The following are various tasks and commands that can be used with Kafka, such as building a jar and running it, running unit/integration tests, and generating test coverage reports. Additionally, Kafka provides information on running a Kafka broker in KRaft or ZooKeeper mode, how to install jars to the local Maven repository, and running code quality checks using Checkstyle and Spotbugs. Kafka also invites community contributions through their Apache mailing lists.
