description: Parquet-MR contains the java implementation of the Parquet format. Parquet is a columnar storage format for Hadoop; it provides efficient storage and encoding of data. Parquet uses the record shredding and assembly algorithm described in the Dremel paper to represent nested structures. Parquet-MR uses Maven to build and depends on the thrift compiler (protoc is now managed by maven plugin). Parquet is a very active project, and new features are being added quickly. The project has Java Vector API support and Map/Reduce integration for input and output formats. Parquet also has implementations for Thrift, Avro, and Protobuf conversion. The project also integrates with Apache Pig and Hive. To contribute to the project, pull requests can be made against the parquet-mr Git repository.
