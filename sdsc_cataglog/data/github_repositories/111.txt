description: Amundsen is a data discovery and metadata engine that improves the productivity of data analysts, data scientists, and engineers when interacting with data. It indexes data resources such as tables, dashboards, and streams, and powers a page-rank style search based on usage patterns. The project is named after Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, the first person to discover the South Pole. Amundsen is hosted by the LF AI & Data Foundation and includes three microservices, one data ingestion library, and one common library. 

Aside from the installation, the Amundsen platform offers various features to help automate workflows, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, collaborate outside of code, and fund open-source developers. The platform also has various community resources and documentation that users can utilize to get started and engage with the Amundsen community.
