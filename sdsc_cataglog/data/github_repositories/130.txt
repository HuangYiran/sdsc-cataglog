description: Metaflow is a human-friendly library that helps scientists and engineers build and manage real-life data science projects. Metaflow provides a simple, friendly API that covers foundational needs of ML, AI, and data science projects. It was originally developed at Netflix to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning. What sets Metaflow apart is its ability to help users go from prototype to production and back seamlessly. While you can get started with Metaflow easily on your laptop, the main benefits of Metaflow lie in its ability to scale out to external compute clusters and to deploy to production-grade workflow orchestrators. Additionally, there is an active community of thousands of data scientists and ML engineers discussing the ins-and-outs of applied machine learning. For more information and installation instructions, see Metaflow's website and documentation.
