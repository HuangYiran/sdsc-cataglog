description: FairML is a python toolbox for auditing black-box predictive models, specifically for quantifying the relative significance of the model’s inputs in order to assess the model’s fairness (or discriminatory extent). This project addresses the potential for unintentional discrimination when deploying predictive models to determine access to services such as credit, insurance, and employment. The toolbox leverages model compression and four input ranking algorithms to quantify a model’s relative predictive dependence on its inputs, making it easier for analysts to audit cumbersome predictive models that are difficult to interpret. The FairML package can be installed via pip, or by cloning the repository. An example model is provided for demonstration purposes.
