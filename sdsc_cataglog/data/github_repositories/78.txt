description: PySpark2PMML is a Python package that allows users to convert Apache Spark ML pipelines to PMML. This package is a thin PySpark wrapper for the JPMML-SparkML library. Users can install a release version from PyPI using pip install pyspark2pmml or alternatively, install the latest snapshot version from GitHub with pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/jpmml/pyspark2pmml.git. Pairing PySpark2PMML with JPMML-SparkML requires a specific compatibility matrix, and individual stages can be customized through conversion options.
