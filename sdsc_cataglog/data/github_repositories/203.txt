description: When classifying user-generated text, there are many ways that users can modify their content to avoid detection. This library called "Artificial-Adversary" allows you to generate texts using these methods and simulate these kinds of attacks on your machine learning models. By exposing your model to these texts offline, you will be able to better prepare for them when you encounter them in an online setting. This project is under active development and can be installed. The library allows users to automate any workflow, host and manage packages, find and fix vulnerabilities, create instant dev environments, write better code with AI, and collaborate outside of code. The library also funds open-source developers and provides community articles. Included in the library are various attacks such as generating attacked texts and simulating attacks on texts. Contributing and acknowledgments are also encouraged.
