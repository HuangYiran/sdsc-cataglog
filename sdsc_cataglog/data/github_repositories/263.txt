description: PySyft is a Python library for secure and private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Encrypted Computation (like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE)) within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. The Syft ecosystem seeks to change the limitation of human collaboration by allowing you to write software which can compute over information you do not own on machines you do not have control over. This not only includes servers in the cloud but also personal desktops, laptops, mobile phones, websites, and edge devices. The PyGrid library serves as an API for the management and deployment of PySyft at scale. PySyft is available on PyPI and Conda, and a more detailed explanation of PySyft can be found in the white paper on Arxiv. The software is in beta, and support is offered through the #support Slack channel.
