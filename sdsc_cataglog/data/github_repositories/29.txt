description: The facets project contains two visualizations for understanding and analyzing machine learning datasets: Facets Overview and Facets Dive. The visualizations are implemented as Polymer web components, backed by Typescript code and can be easily embedded into Jupyter notebooks or webpages. Overview gives a high-level view of one or more data sets. It produces a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis, and can also be used to compare statistics across two or more data sets. The tool can process both numeric and string features, including multiple instances of a number or string per feature. Dive is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of multidimensional data points, allowing users to seamlessly switch between a high-level overview and low-level details. Details about Overview usage can be found in its README. Details about Dive usage can be found in its README. Using Facets in Google Colabratory and Jupyter notebooks can be seen in this notebook. Both Facets visualizations make use of HTML imports. So in order to use them, you must first load the appropriate polyfill, through `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/1.3.3/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>`, as shown in the demo notebooks in this repo. Note that for using Facets Overview in a Jupyter notebook, there are two considerations. The Facets visualizations currently work only in Chrome - Issue 9.
