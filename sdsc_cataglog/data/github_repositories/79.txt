description: MMdnn is a comprehensive and cross-framework tool to convert, visualize and diagnose deep learning (DL) models. The "MM" stands for model management, and "dnn" is the acronym of deep neural network. Major features include model conversion, guidelines to help deploy DL models to another hardware platform, and a model converter to help developers convert models between frameworks through an intermediate representation format. MMdnn provides a local visualizer to display the network architecture of a deep learning model, and there are currently tutorials available to convert models between Keras, TensorFlow, Caffe, MXNet, and more. MMdnn also provides a docker image for easy installation and use. Contributions are welcome from researchers, developers, and students looking to improve DL productivity.
