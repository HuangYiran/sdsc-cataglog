description: Lightly is a computer vision framework for self-supervised learning. We, at Lightly, are passionate engineers who want to make deep learning more efficient. That's why - together with our community - we want to popularize the use of self-supervised methods to understand and curate raw image data. Our solution can be applied before any data annotation step and the learned representations can be used to visualize and analyze datasets. This allows to select the best set of samples for model training through advanced filtering. Lightly offers features like hosted and managed packages, finding and fixing vulnerabilities, instant dev environments, writing better code with AI, collaborating outside of code, funding open source developers, and GitHub community articles. Lightly is compatible with PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning v2.0+, and the vision transformer based models require Torchvision v0.12+. Lightly in Action allows for the use of the latest self-supervised learning methods in a modular way using the full power of PyTorch, and experimenting with different backbones, models, and loss functions. Implemented models and their performance on various datasets behind hyperparameters are not tuned for maximum accuracy. For detailed results and more info about the benchmarks, visit the website.
