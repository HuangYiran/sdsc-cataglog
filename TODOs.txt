Ideas/Bugs:
- Add openml dataset search to console
- Website: Extract keywords from a user input text (similar outputs as the console version)
- Variable number of keywords
- Current Bug: Sometimes ChatGPT returns no or less than 3 keywords
- Extend the repositiory dataset (has currently only 300 entries)
- Current Bug: Some of the repository have in the dataset no description, but if you click the repository url it has a readme
- Add input text of cycling safety example to the readme
- Improve website design (for example hide the headlines "Top 5 Repositories")
